1 Problem formulation 
 
This TRACE element provides supporting information on: The decision-making context in which 
the model will be used; a precise specification of the question(s) that should be answered with the 
model, including a specification of necessary model outputs; and a statement of the domain of 
applicability of the model, including the extent of acceptable extrapolations.  
 
Summary: 
Anthropogenic noise can induce behavioral responses in marine mammals, 
which may influence the individual animals’ foraging success and, 
ultimately, the dynamics of the population. Pile-driving noise associated 
with construction of offshore wind farms and noise from shipping can have 
pervasive effects on the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). In this study 
we present version 3.0 of an agent-based model, the DEPONS model, and 
demonstrate how it can be used for assessing population consequences of 
pile-driving noise and ship noise on the porpoise population in the North 
Sea and the inner Danish waters. Population dynamics emerge from the 
individuals’ competition for a dynamically replenishing food resource and 
from altered movements in the presence of noise. Model predictions are 
influenced by the exact timing and spatial location of individual pile-
driving events and other noise sources. 
 
Marine populations experience increasing levels of noise from offshore renewable 
energy developments, seismic surveys, military sonars and ship traffic (Tyack 2008; 
Slabbekoorn et al. 2010; Nowacek et al. 2015). A comprehensive assessment of the 
effects of anthropogenic disturbances on marine populations is therefore increasingly 
demanded for management of marine ecosystems in Europe and the U.S. (EU Marine 
Strategy Framework Directive 2008; White House Executive Order 2010). Many 
types of offshore activities, including wind farm construction, also require an 
environmental impact assessment (EIA) to be conducted prior to development. EIAs 
are particularly focused at fragile and protected populations, and in European waters 
the species mentioned on the Habitats Directive (EU 1992) are of concern. Critically, 
they often require a cumulative assessment of the population level impacts of the 
primary development in combination with other human activities in the region. The 
model we present here can be used for conducting such EIAs of the cumulative 
impacts of human activities and for spatial planning to ensure that offshore activities 
affect populations as little as possible. 
The model, termed DEPONS, links the dynamics of marine populations directly to the 
individuals’ response to noise. Noise travels over long distances in marine 
environments and induce behavioral responses of affected individuals (DeRuiter et al. 
2013; Miller et al. 2015). This can lead to disruption of natural foraging behavior and 
habitat displacement, with potential consequences for individual survival and 
population dynamics. In the model, population dynamics emerge from the 

--- Page 4 ---
TRACE document: DEPONS 3.0 
 
4 
individuals’ competition for a dynamically replenishing food resource and from 
altered movements and reduced foraging success when noise is present. The model 
was calibrated to assess the impacts of noise from pile-driving of wind turbine 
foundations on harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) in the North Sea. The species 
is listed on the EU Habitats Directive Annexes II and IV, and as pile-driving noise has 
been observed to affect porpoises at distances >20 km (Tougaard et al. 2009; Brandt 
et al. 2011) it is critical to understand this type of noise will influence the population. 
Population densities and the time it takes the population to recover after pile-driving 
ends can be measured either locally or for the entire population. 
The model takes a data-driven, mechanistic approach to management of marine 
populations. Although it is currently parameterized for assessing effects of wind farm 
construction on the North Sea harbor porpoise  population it is based on general 
principles of population regulation and resource availability (Sinclair 2003; Goss-
Custard et al. 2006). This is likely to cause the model to generate robust predictions 
for a wide range of environmental conditions (Grimm & Railsback 2005; Stillman et 
al. 2015), and to make it suitable for other populations and species. 
Although the model is likely to be robust to variations in environmental conditions, it 
should be noted that it was parameterized for the North Sea harbor porpoise 
population. As population dynamics are tightly linked to animal foraging behavior 
and space use (home ranges), the model can only be extrapolated to areas outside the 
North Sea if there are empirical data available for re-calibrating the movement 
patterns. 
DEPONS version 2.3 differs from version 1.1 (used by Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2018) in 
several ways: (1) fine-scale movement patterns are calibrated based on harbor 
porpoise tracking data collected in the North Sea, (2) the animals’ response to pile-
driving noise were re-calibrated after updating their fine-scale movements, and (3) 
their large-scale movement behavior was re-calibrated to ensure that home ranges and 
movement tracks still resembled those of real animals. It differs from version 2.0 by 
(4) re-enabling the Kattegat landscape and the special large-scale movement behavior 
previously used in this landscape (Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2014), (5) the modelling of 
sound propagation from pile-driving events was made more flexible (no longer 
restricted do spherical spreading), (6) simulation of ships was enabled, and (7) prey 
availability and salinity now update monthly instead of every three months. Version 
2.2 differs from version 2.1 mainly by allowing users to use blocks files for counting 
animals in specific regions when simulating population dynamics in the inner Danish 
waters (see change log). Version 2.3 introduces a new way of calculating sound 
source levels for ships (MacGillivray & de Jong 2021) and propagation loss and for 
defining ship routes. Version 3.0 Introduces (1) a new way of modelling sound 
propagation from ships and (2) the animals’ response to noise from ships (Frankish et 
al. In prep).

Summary: 
Here we present the complete description of DEPONS 3.0. The model 
extends previous models for simulating impacts of anthropogenic 
disturbances on harbor porpoise populations (Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2014, 
2018). The model description follows the updated ODD (Overview, Design 
concepts, Details) protocol (Grimm et al. 2010). It includes an overview of 
the underlying fine-scale movement model, a description of how simulated 
animals respond to noise and a description of the mechanisms that control 
their large-scale movements. The model, which was implemented in Repast 
Simphony 2.10.0 (http://repast.sourceforge.net), is open-source and 
published under the GNU General Public License v2. It can be downloaded

2.1 
Purpose 
The model simulates how harbor porpoise population dynamics are affected by pile-
driving noise emitted during construction of offshore wind farms and by noise emitted 
from ships. The animals’ survival is directly related to their energy levels, and the 
population dynamics are affected by noise through its impact on the animals’ foraging 
behavior. By ensuring that the animals’ movement patterns, space use and reactions to 
noise are realistic, the population dynamics should have the same causal drivers in the 
model as in nature. 
2.2 
Entities, state variables, and scales 
The model includes six kinds of entities: porpoises, wind turbines, ships, 
hydrophones, landscape grid cells and cell groups. The porpoise agents are 
characterized by their location, speed, movement direction, age, age of maturity, 
energy level, pregnancy status, lactation status and movement mode. Each porpoise 
agent is a ‘super individual’ (Scheffer et al. 1995) representing several real-world 
female porpoises. Ship agents are characterized by their location, speed, length, type, 
and noise source level. Hydrophones are characterized by their location. Wind turbine 
agents are characterized by their location, noise source level, start time and end time 
for their construction.  
Simulations are by default based on a 835.2 km × 870 km landscape covering the 
North Sea. The landscape is divided into 2088 × 2175 grid cells, each covering 400 m 
× 400 m, and into cell groups covering 2 km × 2 km. The choice of cell sizes was 
arbitrary. Cell groups do not have state variables but are characterized exclusively by 
their location. They enable porpoises to navigate back to areas where they have been 
before when using large-scale movements. Grid cells are characterized by their 
coordinates, water depth, sea surface salinity, food level, maximum food level, 
distance to land, sediment grain size, and by whether they are used as food patches or 
not. The default landscape includes land and bodies of water with unknown food 
levels (northern part of the North Sea; Figure 1), i.e., areas that are not used by 
simulated porpoises (42.0% of the grid cells), food patches (0.67%) and water without 
food (57.3%). Each of the 30549 food patches covers one grid cell. The food level is 
always zero for grid cells that are not used as food patches. The distribution of the 
food patches is identical to the one used by Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2013b, 2014), i.e. it 
included on average 1000 food patches per 100 km × 100 km. The number of food 
patches is arbitrary, but sufficiently large to enable simulated porpoises to develop 
realistic movement patterns. The only other environmental parameter in the model is 
the time of year. 
2.3 
Process overview and scheduling 
The model proceeds in half-hour time steps and simulations typically cover 50 years. 
At the beginning of each time step porpoises detect noise originating from active pile-
driving operations and ships. This permits animals within a certain radius from the 
noise source to know where the noise comes from and the received sound level. The 
radius depends on the sound source level, propagation loss and a threshold sound level 
below which they do not react to noise.

The animals’ fine-scale movements are controlled by a combination of correlated 
random walk (CRW) behavior (Turchin 1998), their ability to move towards known 
food patches (directed by a spatial memory) and the extent to which they are deterred 
by noise. CRW movements predominate as long as energy intake is high, else animals 
gradually become more directed towards patches where they have previously found 
food (Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2013b). The animals turn and slow down if there is land 
ahead. Animals are deterred by noise, and the strength of the bias away from the noise 
source depends on the received sound level. Deterrence from ships also depends on 
the distance to the ships and the period of the day (day or night). The noise level does 
not affect the length of their fine-scale moves. Animals can remain deterred for some 
time after exposure to noise from piling stops, although to a decreasing extent (by 
default this behavior is turned off). The updating of this ‘residual deterrence’ takes 
place at the end of each time step. 
The animals’ energy levels and mortality are tightly coupled in the model. An 
animal’s energy level (scaled to lie in the range 0–20) increases when it encounters 
food in a food patch but decreases with every move. Animals consume a decreasing 
fraction of the food as their energy levels increase from 10 to 20, assuming that there 
is a limit to how much energy they can store. Consumption of food causes their 
energy levels to increase equivalently. Their energy expenditure per time step depends 
on the season and whether they are lactating. The lower their energy levels, the higher 
their risk of dying. Animals with lactating calves do not die but abandon their calves 
instead. Individual energy budgets were constructed following established principles 
of physiological ecology (Sibly et al. 2013). The animals move one at a time in an 
order that is randomized after each half-hour time step. Animals whose energy levels 
have been decreasing for some time stop using fine-scale movements and start using 
large-scale movements to move towards more profitable areas (cell groups). 
Food is only found in the food patches, which are randomly distributed across the 
landscape. The maximum amount of food (energy) varies among patches and seasons. 
It is derived from seasonal maps of the relative porpoise densities in the North Sea 
(Figure 1; Gilles et al. 2016), assuming that porpoises are only observed in areas with 
sufficient food. Updating of the food distribution map takes place four times per year. 
The actual amount of food in the patches changes dynamically: When a porpoise 
visits a patch, it consumes all or part of the food found there, but afterwards the food 
level increases logistically until reaching the maximum level. The updating of patch 
energy levels, i.e. replenishment of food, takes place at the end of every simulation 
day, after porpoises have moved and consumed the food they encountered. 
At the end of each day a number of life-history processes take place: Porpoises die if 
they reach their maximum age. They may mate, depending on the time of the year and 
their age. If they are already pregnant, they may give birth. If accompanied by a 
lactating calf they may wean the calf, which results in the creation of a new, 
independent individual in the model (if the calf is a female). Independent male 
porpoises are not included in the model, as the number of males was not considered a 
limiting factor for reproduction. The number of males is therefore not expected to 
affect population dynamics. Once every year, new mating dates are calculated. 
The food distribution map (Figure 1) is updated at the end of each month, i.e., on day 
30, 60, …, and 330 (the model assumes 30 days per month).

The different variables in the model are updated asynchronously, i.e., immediately 
after a process has been executed. 
2.4 
Design concepts 
2.4.1 Basic principles: The model builds on the assumption that the porpoise 
population is food limited. Noise acts by scaring porpoises away and by 
causing habitat fragmentation, thereby reducing the animals’ foraging 
efficiency. The animals’ foraging efficiency is also influenced by their ability 
to return to high quality areas they have previously visited, which assumes that 
they have a spatial memory (Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2013b). The animals’ energy 
budgets are represented using the model presented by Sibly et al. (2013). 
2.4.2 Emergence: The equilibrium population size (carrying capacity) emerges from 
a balance between mortality and reproduction, where mortality is linked to the 
energy levels of individual animals (i.e., porpoise agents). The energy levels, 
in turn, emerge from a balance between energy expenditure and food intake. 
Animals adapt their fine-scale movement behavior to increase food intake and 
fitness when they have not found food in the recent past. The size of the 
animals’ home ranges emerges from their experience of the profitability of 
different parts of the landscape, which guides their large-scale movements. 
The animals’ spatial distribution emerges from their tendency to move towards 
more profitable parts of the landscape when using large-scale movements and 
from elevated mortality in unprofitable areas. Their age class distribution 
emerges from their starvation-related mortality. 
The rate at which local porpoise densities recover after a pile-driving operations end 
emerge from the animals’ decision to either return to previously visited food patches 
close to the pile-driving area, to utilize food patches in the area they were displaced 
to, or to start using large-scale movements. Their choice between these three 
alternatives depends on their energetic state and their success finding food in the area 
they were displaced to. 
2.4.3 Adaptation: Animals react to decreasing food levels in particular patches by 
being less attracted to them. They react to decreasing energy levels by moving 
towards parts of the landscape (i.e., cell groups) where they have previously 
experienced a high energy intake rate. 
2.4.4 Objectives: Animals attempt to optimize their foraging behavior, and hence 
maximize their fitness, by returning to previously visited food patches when 
correlated random walk movements result in a low food acquisition rate. They 
also attempt to optimize foraging by moving towards more profitable areas 
using large-scale movements when the fine-scale movements do not enable 
them to sustain their energy levels. 

--- Page 9 ---
TRACE document: DEPONS 3.0

2.4.5 Learning: Animals do not learn from what other individuals have experienced. 
They do remember the location of previously visited food patches for some 
days (Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2013b), which enables them to adapt their fine-scale 
movements. They also have a persistent memory of the energy intake rate 
experienced in all cell groups they have visited since they were born, so they 
gradually learn about the profitability of different parts of the landscape. This 
guides their large-scale movement behavior. The animals learn/inherit a map 
of the profitability and location of previously visited cell groups from their 
mother before entering the model as independent individuals. 
2.4.6 Prediction: Animals base their prediction of how much food they can gather in 
different areas on their previous visits to those areas. 
2.4.8 Sensing: Animals can sense if there is land in the direction they are about to 
move, which permits them to turn towards deeper water to avoid the coast. 
They also sense noise, which causes them to turn away from the noise emitting 
object(s). The animals sense when their energy levels decrease, which causes 
them to start using large-scale movements and to be more likely to abandon 
their lactating calves or die. 
2.4.9 Interaction: The modeled animals only interact indirectly via competition for 
food. 
2.4.10 Stochasticity: Fine-scale movement, mating date and mortality involve 
stochastic events. The probability of surviving increases with increasing 
energy levels. 
2.4.11 Collectives: Social structure is not included in the model, but each porpoise 
agent represents several real animals. 
2.4.12 Observation: The number of animals, their energy levels, and the total amount 
of food in the landscape are recorded daily. The number of animals in different 
parts of the landscape can be counted (corresponding to areas defined in the 
‘blocks file’), and the movement tracks of a specified number of animals can 
be recorded to analyze for variations in home range sizes etc. Noise 
propagating from ships can be measured using hydrophone agents placed at 
fixed locations, and the extent to which animals react to noise can be recorded 
for each half-hourly position. The age-class distribution and age specific 
mortalities are recorded yearly. 
2.5 
Initialization 
The model is by default initialized by creating 10,000 randomly distributed porpoise 
agents. Their age-class distribution corresponds to that of stranded and by-caught 
animals (Lockyer & Kinze 2003), and 68% of the adults in the model are pregnant 
(parameter h in Table 1). The initial values for the animals’ energy levels, Ep, are 
drawn from a normal distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation one (parameter 
Einit). Mating date (tmating) is a random normal variable with mean 225 and standard 
deviation 20. The scenarios presented by Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2018) assume that 
simulations start on 1 January 1981. The North Sea wind-farm construction scenarios 
include 3900 piling operations distributed on 65 wind farms that were planned to be

built in the period 2011–2020 as part of the European Union 2020 goals (Directive 
2009/28/EC, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32009L0028, summarized in 
http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/publications/reports/Sea
nergy_2020.pdf). The food levels in the patches are initially set to the location 
specific maximum food levels for 1 January.  
Model simulations can be initialized and executed through a Graphical User Interface 
(GUI) or through a batch procedure. The GUI allows for one simulation run at a time 
and enables the user to view the porpoise movements and distribution across the 
landscape, the location and construction period of wind farms, the movements of 
ships, the location of hydrophone agents, the population size, energy levels of 
porpoise agents, energy levels in food patches distributed across the landscape, as 
well as the age class distribution of the population. During a simulation the porpoise 
agents change color depending on their energy level, from green (optimal, associated 
with low mortality) to orange, yellow and red as the energy level decreases. Porpoise 
agents change color to purple when deterred by noise. In the batch procedure the user 
can initialize multiple simulations that run simultaneously, but the simulations are not 
visualized on the screen, and no information on age class distribution is provided. 
Batch simulations are defined using batch parameters stored in .xml files. These can 
be generated from within the DEPONS program. The default parameter file is 
batch_params.xml, which is distributed with DEPONS. In the batch simulations, 
multiple values can be specified for parameters. Each value can be specified as either 
a constant (single value), a number range with from, to and step values or as a list of 
values. When the batch simulation is started, a simulation is created for each possible 
combination of parameter values (this is called parameter unrolling to cover the 
parameter space). Multiple simulations can be run simultaneously depending on the 
configuration in the "Hosts" tab. The default is to run two concurrent simulations 
(instances) on the local machine (the <user>@localhost of the left). It is possible to 
distribute the simulation runs to multiple hosts via the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. 
Once all the simulations have completed, the individual output files are collected and 
combined into output files containing the values across all the simulation runs. An 
additional column is added to distinguish the individual runs. Once the simulation(s) 
has completed, the model output is automatically written out for both the GUI and 
batch procedure.

the winter, so the map from the autumn was used instead. 
2.6 
Input data 
Seven different kinds of background maps are used in the model. The maximum 
amount of food in each food patch was derived from maps of the porpoise densities in 
the different parts of the North Sea (see Gilles et al. 2016 for details). These are 
included as twelve raster files with a spatial resolution of 400 m × 400 m, one for 
each month. The spring estimate (Figure 1a) was used for the months March–May, 
summer was used for June–August, and autumn estimate was used for September–
February (there is no winter estimate). There is no food outside the food patches. The 
raster file for January is read in from the file ‘prey0000_01.asc’ at the start of 
simulations. When running multi-year simulations, there is an option to provide 
separate files for different years by replacing the ‘0000’ in the file name with the year, 
and it is also possible to use the same file for all months by changing the month 
number to ‘XX’. The ETRS89 projection (EPSG:3035) is used in North Sea 
simulations (including DanTysk and Gemini landscapes) and UTM 32 N 
(EPSG:32632) is used in the inner Danish waters (the Kattegat landscape). In 
simulations based on UserDefined landscapes any coordinate reference system can be 
used. The raster maps were standardized to have a mean value of 0.3914, 
corresponding to the mean food level previously used in simulations of the inner 
Danish waters population (Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2014). Six additional types of raster 
data with the same extent and resolution are used: a ‘patches’ file describing the 
location of the food patches, a ‘bathymetry’ file that allows animals to avoid water 
depths <wmin (see parameter list), a ‘distance-to-coast’ file (allowing animals to turn 
when approaching land), a ‘sediment grain size’ file that is used to model ship noise 
propagation, a ‘blocks’ file that makes it possible to count the number of porpoises in 
user defined areas, and twelve different ‘salinity’ files, one for each month (labeled 
the same way as the ‘prey’ files). Blocks files can be generated using the 
make.blocksraster function in the DEPONS2R package for R (https://CRAN.R-
project.org/package=DEPONS2R). Salinity data were downloaded from the 
Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (http://marine.copernicus.eu) 
and derived from the Forecasting Ocean Assimilation Model 7 km Atlantic Margin 
model (FOAM AMM7) for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea Physics Reanalysis 
product (BALTICSEA_REANALYSIS_PHY_003_011) for the Kattegat landscape 
(monthly data from 2021; accessed in March 2023). Median sediment grain size data 
were derived from an extension of Bockelmann et al. (2018)'s map which was created 
by establishing a relationship between median grain size and the Folk classification 
scheme (Folk 1954; see appendix 1 for details).  
Simulations include details about pile-driving events. These are provided in a tab 
separated ‘wind-farms’ text file with columns id (identifier; missing values allowed), 
x, y (coordinates), impact (sound source level, dB SEL @1m), start and end (timing 
of pile-driving, measured in number of half-hour time steps since the beginning of the 
simulation; only integer values accepted). Noise is emitted during both the start and 
the end time step. Note that each year consists of 360 × 48 = 17,280 ticks. The sound 
source level is 234 dB SEL in the default North Sea pile-driving scenarios, 
corresponding to the value calculated for the Gemini wind farm (see the Submodels

turbine agents was represented in the model).  
 
Figure 2. Positions of wind turbines in the three pile-driving scenarios used in this study. The red 
square on (a) indicates the 50 km × 50 km area shown in greater detail in (b). 
Three different scenarios are included to allow users to investigate population effects 
of wind farm construction in the North Sea. These were the scenarios used by Nabe-
Nielsen et al. (2018). All scenarios include 65 wind farms with the same spatial 
distribution (Figure 2). The number of wind farms per country is the same in all 
scenarios (Denmark: 1 wind farm; Germany: 21; Netherlands: 14; Belgium: 5; UK: 
24), which is the number of wind farms that would enable the individual countries to 
meet the EU 2020 target for renewable energy development (EU 2009). Wind farms 
were selected in areas with water depths between 15–40 m and >4 km from any 
neighboring wind farm. Aside from these rules, wind farms were placed at random, at 
the same locations in all North Sea scenarios. Each wind farm includes 60 wind 
turbines distributed in a regular 1078 m x 1078 m grid. 6 MW turbines constructed 
with monopile foundations was assumed throughout. Turbines are installed using pile-
driving, and installation of a single foundation takes two hours. No noise mitigation or 
soft start is included in the scenarios. The turbines are constructed in the 10-year 
period starting 1 January 2011, with 6–7 farms being built per year. In Scenario 1 
(called “Random, slow” in Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2018), the parks are constructed in 
random order, in Scenario 2 (“Ordered, slow”) the parks in the eastern North Sea are 
built first, followed by the ones in the western North Sea (starting in the north in each 
area). In Scenario 3 (“Random, fast”) parks are constructed in the same order as in 
Scenario 1, but the time between individual pilings within the wind farms is halved 
(from 48 hours to 24 hours). The start time of the first pilings in the different wind 
farms is the same in scenarios 1 and 3.

Figure 3. Data from the Gemini wind farm construction site used for calibration of the porpoises’ 
response to noise. (a) Virtual landscape including wind turbine construction sites (black dots) and 
CPODs (red dots). The black line shows the border to Germany. (b) Received sound levels recorded 
using hydrophones at different distances [m] from two pilings. Sound source levels (SL) and sound 
transmissions were calculated assuming spherical spreading of sound. 
A different landscape, combined with a different set of simulated pile-driving events, 
was used for calibration of the parameters c and T (see parameter list). The landscape 
was a 400 × 400 cell subset of the North Sea landscape covering the area around the 
Gemini wind farm construction site in the Netherlands (Figure 3). The landscape 
included a number of virtual CPODs (i.e., acoustic monitoring stations that detect the 
presence of porpoises based on the clicks they emit while foraging and navigating) 
whose positions corresponded to those of real CPODs deployed during wind farm 
construction. The 160 pile-driving events had the exact same positions as those of the 
real pile-driving events. Their sound source levels (‘impact’; 234 dB SEL @1m) were 
calculated based on data from four hydrophones placed near two of the pile-driving 
locations (Figure 3b). SEL provides a measure of the energy transmitted by one single 
blow expressed as a level. The energy is normalized to a time of one second. See 
details on calibration of the porpoises’ response to noise in the section ‘Data 
evaluation’. 
In DEPONS 2.1 and later it is possible to simulate ships that move along pre-defined 
routes. These are defined using virtual ‘buoys’ that also specify the speed ships should 
move at until encountering another buoy and the number of ticks that ships should 
pause by the buoy before moving further. The required input data are stored in files 
named ‘ships.json’ in the directory for the selected landscape. Ships are characterized 
by their name, speed, type and length, and the route they should move along. Speeds 
are measured in knots. Data on ships and routes are read into DEPONS from a file 
named ‘ships.json’ which can be created using the DEPONS2R package for R 
(https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DEPONS2R). In DEPONS 2.3 and later this 
file no longer includes information on the level of the sound emitted by individual 
ships, which is instead calculated within DEPONS. An example file is provided for 
the Kattegat landscape. Ship routes are defined using the same coordinate reference 
system as the underlying landscape.

In DEPONS 2.3 and later, the positions of hydrophones are defined in files named 
‘hydrophones.csv’. Each row contains the x and y coordinates of one hydrophone. 
In DEPONS 3.0 and later, sound propagation loss for ship noise is modelled using the 
Weston flux integral method (Weston 1959). Ships are assumed to produce a 
negligible amount of noise (source level (SL) = 0) if they are on land. Simulated 
porpoises react to ship noise by being deterred and the deterrence in part depends on 
the period of the day (see section 2.7.1 for details). The period of the day, ‘day’ vs. 
‘night’ is defined by the timing of sunrise and sunset on a given day in a csv file 
named ‘suntimes.csv’, which is stored in the directory of all available landscapes. If 
no ‘suntimes.csv’ file is available, then the default is for the simulation to run during 
daytime. 
2.7 
Submodels 
The different submodels are executed in the order they are listed below (see overview 
in ‘Process overview and scheduling’). Names of variables and parameters are 
retained from Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2013b, 2014, 2018). 
2.7.1 Porpoises detect noise 
At the beginning of each time step, porpoises register the noise from active pile-
driving operations and nearby ships. This is done by letting the wind turbine and ship 
agents emit noise, thus producing a dynamic soundscape. Noise source levels (SL) and 
positions of turbines and timings of pile-driving events are provided as input data. 
Noise source levels of ships are calculated based on ship length, size, speed and 
frequency of interest following MacGillivray & de Jong (2021). Source and received 
sound pressure levels are calculated for the decidecade band centered at 16 kHz. 
Animals react to noise only up to a certain distance from the sound source. For pile-
driving noise, this distance is determined by the response threshold (T) and the extent 
to which sound is transmitted in water. T was determined based on data from the 
Gemini wind farm using pattern-oriented modeling. For ships, porpoises react from a 
minimum distance defined by dmin_deter_ships up to 10 km from a given ship (Table 3). 
The sound level received by the animals (Rpiling) from pile-driving events was 
modeled assuming spherical spreading during calibration of T (Figure 4a; Urick 
1983). When  
Rpiling = SL – 𝛽̂log10(dist(p,k)) – 𝛼̂(dist(p,k)) 
Eqn. A1 
where dist(p,k) is the distance from the porpoise p to the pile-driving event k, 
spherical spreading occurs when the spreading loss factor 𝛽̂ is 20 and the absorption 
coefficient 𝛼̂ is zero. Noise emitted by a pile-driving operation only influences 
animals out to a certain distance, distmax, where Rpiling = T. By rearranging Eqn. 1 and 
setting for 𝛽̂=20 and 𝛼̂=0 we get  
distmax = 10(SL – T) / 20  
Eqn. A2 
Each pile-driving event equips all porpoises within the distance distmax with a 
deterrence vector that points directly away from the noise source (Figure 4). The 
length of the deterrence vector VD is determined by  
|VD| = c(Rpiling – T) 
Eqn. A3 

--- Page 15 ---
TRACE document: DEPONS 3.0 
 
15 
assuming a linear relationship between the received sound level and the strength of 
reaction. Here c is the deterrence coefficient. Each animal’s fine-scale movements are 
only influenced by the sound source that yields the largest deterrence vector.  
Animals can be assumed to sense the distance to anthropogenic noise sources, (as 
demonstrated by DeRuiter et al. 2013) and to stop being deterred when they are 
further away from the noise than a certain distance. When dist(p,k) > dmax_deter the 
length of the deterrence vector is therefore set to 0. When using the default value of 
dmax_deter (Table 2), this parameter does not affect population dynamics. The parameter 
is only included to make it possible to assume a maximum deterrence distance in 
other studies. 
 
Figure 4. Relationship between received sound level (R) and deterrence behavior in response to pile-
driving sounds. (a) Decrease in Rpiling with distance assuming spherical spreading of pile-driving noise 
and source levels as observed in Gemini (wind farm constructed without noise mitigation; 
SEL@1m=234 dB = SL in eqn. A1). The green bar shows the length of the deterrence vector for a 
porpoise located 4 km from the pile-driving, |VD|, i.e. the bias away from the noise. VD can also 
represent deterrence from ship noise depending on which noise source causes the largest impact, i.e., 
largest |VD| (see Eqn. A35).  Here distmax= 11350 m. (b) Vector VS represents the correlated random 
walk during one 30-min time step, VM represents the spatial memory move and VD represents the 
deterrence from noise. V is the standardized resultant vector, i.e. the actual move in the presence of 
noise, here shown for c=10 (deterrence coefficient; arbitrary value) and Threshold (T)=152.9 dB.  
The sound pressure level received by porpoises from ships (Rship; dB re 1 Pa) is 
calculated as follows: 
𝑅ship = 𝐿𝑠,ship −𝑁𝑃𝐿 
Eqn. A4 
where Ls,ship is a ship’s underwater radiated noise source level (in dB re 1 Pa m), 
calculated as a function of ship type, speed and length following the JOMOPANS-
ECHO source model (MacGillivray & de Jong 2021), and for the decidecade band 
centred on 16 kHz (f). NPL is propagation loss (dB re 1 m) and is based on the Weston 
flux integral method (Weston 1959):

where Dship is the range between a ship and a porpoise agent (km), Wship is water depth 
(m) at the ship location (and is extracted from the bathymetry layer available in the 
different DEPONS landscapes), 𝜂 (Np/rad) is the seabed’s reflection loss gradient, 𝛼𝑊 
(Np/m) is attenuation of sound by water, erf(x) is the error function, and 𝜃𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 (rad) is 
the critical propagation grazing angle:  
𝜃𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡= acos (

Eqn. A7 
where 𝑣 is the ratio of sound speed in sediment (m/s) to sound speed in water (m/s).

Eqn. A9 
𝜂=  0                     if 𝜈= 1 
Eqn. A10 
where 𝑤 is the ratio of sediment density (kg/m3) to density of water (kg/m3). These 
parameters were assumed to be constant between the source (ship) and receiver 
(porpoise); with v =1700/1500 m/s and w = 1500/1000 kg/m3. 𝜀 is related to the 
sediment attenuation coefficient s (dB/; and found in Table 4.17 of Ainslie 2010) by  
𝜀= 𝛽𝑠⋅ 
log𝑒(10)
40𝜋                
Eqn. A11 
Finally, attenuation of sound in water (𝛼𝑊; dB/m) is based on Van Moll’s absorption 
formula (Van Moll et al. 2009), which estimates this parameter as a function of 
frequency (Hz), pH (measured on the NBS scale), salinity (S; g/kg or ppt), 
temperature (𝜉; degrees Celsius) and water depth (z; m):

To reduce computational load, 𝜉 and pH are kept constant using typical values for the 
Baltic (𝜉 = 10 degrees Celsius and pH = 8) and since depth dependence is negligible 
for depths smaller than 500 m, z = 0 m. Salinity values are extracted from monthly 
layers available in the different DEPONS landscapes. Water attenuation (𝛼𝑤) is 
usually given in dB/m and can be converted to Np/m using:

Deterrence from this disturbance (VD) is calculated for every 1-minute ‘micro-tick’ 
(VD_ship_microtick) within a tick (30 micro-ticks per tick, see Figure 5): 
𝑉𝐷= Σ𝑉𝐷_𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝_𝑚𝑖𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑘  
Eqn. A23 
𝑉𝐷_𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝_𝑚𝑖𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑘= Ω𝑉𝐷_𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝_𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑐𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝  
Eqn. A24 
where Ω determines whether a deterrence occurs or not according to ω, a random 
number in the range [0; 1] and pship, the probability of a porpoise reacting to a given 
ship in each micro-tick:  
Ω = {1, 𝜔< 𝑝𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝
0, 𝜔≥𝑝𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝 
Eqn. A25 
Furthermore, cship determines the magnitude of deterrence and VD_ship_unity  is a unity 
vector pointing directly away from the ship. Here, pship and cship are determined by the 
noise received from the loudest ship (Rship), the distance between an animal and the 
loudest ship (dship), and the period of the day (‘𝜎’- day vs. night; Figure 6) according 
to:  
𝑝𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝= inv. logit(𝑝𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝_𝑖𝑛𝑡_𝜎+ 𝑝𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝_𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒_𝜎𝑅𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝_𝑚𝑎𝑥+ 𝑝𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝_𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡_𝜎𝑑𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝+

to noise, distance and period of the day following Frankish et al. (In prep). pship and 
cship are obtained by back-transforming from the logit and log scales, respectively, and 
Rship_max and dship are scaled versions of noise and distance values measured in 
Frankish et al. (In prep).  
 
 
Figure 5. Within a tick, ship tracks are broken down into 30 micro-ticks. Deterrence at the tick-level 
(VD) is the sum of deterrence vectors estimated at the micro-tick level (VD_ship_microtick). VD_ship_microtick is a 
movement vector pointing directly away from a ship at a given micro-tick.

Figure 6: The probability of a porpoise being deterred (pship) by noise from a ship and the magnitude of 
deterrence (cship; meters moved per minute away from the ship) at the end of a tick depends on the 
noise received from a ship (Rship), the distance between the porpoise and the ship (Dship) from which 
Rship originates, and the period of the day (: day vs. night).  
Frankish et al. (In prep) used a range-dependent approach for modelling Rship, which 
considers change in water depth between a source (ship) and receiver (porpoise). 
However, in DEPONS, a range-independent approach was used (i.e., assuming 
constant depth) to reduce computational load. This substitution was deemed suitable 
as mean differences in Rship using both approaches for the decidecade band centered 
on 16 kHz was negligible for the range of ship and porpoise locations considered in 
Frankish et al. (In prep; mean difference of 0.23 +/- 1.23 dB re 1 Pa2). Furthermore, 
relationships between pship, cship, Rship and Dship were the same using both approaches 
(Figure 5 and see Figure 4 in Frankish et al. In prep).  
2.7.2 Large-scale movements 
We distinguish large-scale movements from the fine-scale movements described in 
section 2.7.3. In each time step porpoises take either a large-scale movement step or a 

--- Page 20 ---
TRACE document: DEPONS 3.0 
 
20 
fine-scale movement step depending on their movement mode (updated in the 
submodel ‘Life history processes’). 
 
Figure 7. Tracks of 34 free-ranging porpoises equipped with ARGOS satellite tags. Six animals were 
tagged by Rømø (southern Denmark), the rest were tagged by Skagen (northern Denmark). Tracks 
were interpolated to one position per day using a state-space model. Each track includes100 positions. 
Animals that use large-scale movements are guided by a persistent spatial memory 
(PSM) of the energy intake rates they have achieved in each of the different parts (cell 
groups) of the landscape they have visited since they were born. Fine-scale 
movements, in contrast, are guided by a gradually decreasing memory of the foraging 
success in recently visited food patches. The rationale for introducing PSM to guide 
large-scale movements is that satellite tagged animals tend to return to the same 
general part of the landscape after having been elsewhere for several weeks or months 
(Figure 7). Such behavior must be guided by a spatial memory. Often such large-scale 
movements gradually switch from being relatively directed to becoming increasingly 
exploratory, which would enable animals to search for new foraging grounds in the 
vicinity of areas where they previously experienced a high food intake rate.

Figure 8. Memory-based large-scale movement behavior used in DEPONS 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2. (A) When 
starting to use this behavior, porpoises move towards the most profitable 2 km × 2 km cell group (B) in 
the preferred distance (PSM_dist). The distance from A to B is dtarget. All large-scale moves have the 
length ddisp and the total distance moved in a particular large-scale movement event is dcum. After each 
large-scale move, the porpoise makes a random turn . The turning angle increases the further the 
porpoise has moved from the starting point. The animal switches to using fine-scale moves when 
dcum=0.95  dtarget (at point C), but it may start using large-scale movements again at a later point (D). 
2.7.2.1 PSM-Type2 
The PSM large-scale movement behavior used in DEPONS 1.1, 2.0 to 2.3 is labeled 
PSM-Type2. Animals switch from using fine-scale to large-scale movements when 
their energy levels have been decreasing for ttodisp days (following Nabe-Nielsen et al. 
2014). All large-scale moves have the length ddisp (Figure 8). 
To enable animals to use PSM movements, the entire landscape is divided into 2 km × 
2 km cell groups. When animals start using PSM-Type2 large-scale movements, they 
turn towards the center of the most profitable cell group at the preferred distance 
(PSM_dist ± PSM_tol, see Table 2), i.e. the group where they have previously 
obtained the highest energy intake rates (calculated as total amount of food eaten 
divided time spent in each cell group). The distance to the center of this cell group is 
dtarget. Initially, PSM_dist is drawn from a normal distribution for each animal, but 
calves subsequently inherit the preferred distance from their mothers. Animals that 
have visited <50 cell groups move towards a random cell group at the preferred 
distance (burn-in behavior). Turning angles  between consecutive steps increase 
logistically,  
 = PSM_angle 2/(1+e–z/PSM_log) 
Eqn. A28 

--- Page 22 ---
TRACE document: DEPONS 3.0 
 
22 
where 𝜔2 is a random number in the range [–1; 1] and z is determined by  
z = (3 × dcum / dtarget) – 1.5 
Eqn. A29 
Here dcum is the cumulated distance moved using in the current large-scale movement 
event, and PSM_log is >0 (see Table 2). Turning angles gradually increase from a 
value close to 0 (depending on the choice of PSM_log) to a maximum of PSM_angle 
(see Figure 9). 
Animals stop using large-scale movements (a) once the cumulated distance moved is 
0.95 × dtarget, (b) if the next step would have caused them to move to an area with 
water depth<wdisp or (c) across the border of the landscape, or (d) if their daily average 
energy levels increase to a level that is higher than any of the daily energy levels they 
have experienced over the previous seven days, or (e) if they move into an area with 
high noise levels (where R>T). 
New independent calves inherit their mothers’ preferred large-scale movement 
distances (PSM_dist), as well as the knowledge about the relative profitability of 
different parts of the landscape. See Section 3.2.4 for details regarding calibration of 
parameters. 
 
 
Figure 9. Simulated change in turning angle distribution as porpoise agents approach the target cell 
group while using PSM-Type2 large-scale movements. In this example, PSM_angle was set to 40 and 
PSM_log to 0.5. Each dot represents a large-scale move (1987 steps within 26 distinct large-scale 
movement events). Angles are larger for animals that have moved a larger proportion of the initial 
distance to their targets. 
2.7.2.2 Undirected movements 
DEPONS 2.0 and later also include a simple large-scale movement behavior, where 
each step is of length ddisp and turning angles between subsequent steps are drawn at 
random in the range [–PSM_angle/2; PSM_angle/2]. The first step is taken in a 

--- Page 23 ---
TRACE document: DEPONS 3.0 
 
23 
random direction. This movement behavior cannot be calibrated to produce home 
ranges that resemble those of North Sea animals, but has been included as a simple 
null model. Conditions for turning this behavior on and off are the same as for PSM-
Type2. 
2.7.2.3 Inner Danish waters movements 
DEPONS 2.1 and 2.2 include a large-scale movement behavior which enables animals 
to navigate through the narrow straits in the inner Danish waters without being 
trapped in bays etc. This behavior, which is called InnerDanishWaters movements, 
was described as dispersal behavior by Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2014). Animals that use 
this behavior picks a random 40km  40 km grid cell among the twelve grid cells with 
the highest potential food level. After turning towards the centre of this grid cell, the 
animal turns 0°, 10° or 20° towards the place with deepest water in every step, 
provided that there is no land 8  ddisp away in that direction (see definition of ddisp in  
Table 2). Then it turns 0°, 10°, 20° or 30° away from land if there is land 2  ddisp 
away. If this does not ensure that the animal stays at a depth ≥ wdisp, the animal turns 
180° away from the position visited exactly one day ago, and turns up to 80° and 
move at a constant distance (1–4 km) from land. Every step has the length ddisp.  
The InnerDanishWaters movement behavior has only been tested for the Kattegat 
landscape. The triggers for turning this behavior on and off are the same as for the 
other large-scale movement behaviors.  
2.7.3 Fine-scale movements 
All animals that are not using large-scale movements take a fine-scale move in each 
time step. This usually causes animals to move straight through the food patches they 
encounter. 
The length and direction of a fine-scale move is determined by the sum of three 
vectors: VS, which describes a correlated random walk (CRW) move (Turchin 1998), 
VM, which describes a spatial memory move, and VD, which describes the deterrence 
from noise (Figure 4b). The CRW behavior introduces a positive correlation between 
the lengths of consecutive steps and a negative correlation between consecutive 
turning angles. Here the CRW component of the fine-scale move is 
VS = x(k + E) 
Eqn. A30 
where x is a vector defining an unweighted CRW move and k is an ‘inertia constant’ 
(see list of parameters related to movement, Table 2). E is a measure of the benefit of 
using an undirected search for food, which is determined by how much food the 
animal remembers that it has found in the recent past. This is controlled by the actual 
amount of food encountered and the satiation memory decay rate rS (Nabe-Nielsen et 
al. 2013b). As k is small, the length of VS is mostly related to E, which is used as a 
proxy for how much food the animal should expect to find if taking an undirected 
CRW step. The length of vector x depends on the length of the previous step, water 
depth, and salinity,  
δt = R1 + a0 δt-1 + a1 wt-1 + a2 st-1  
Eqn. A31 

--- Page 24 ---
TRACE document: DEPONS 3.0 
 
24 
where the length of x = 10010 and R1 is a random normal variable, following Nabe-
Nielsen et al. (2013b), and wt-1 and st-1 are water depth and sea surface salinity at the 
end of the previous time step, respectively. The dependence of  on salinity and water 
depth was introduced in DEPONS 2.0 to reproduce the fine-scale movements 
observed for free-ranging animals in the North Sea (van Beest et al. 2018a).  
The vector x also allows turning angles to depend on the turning angle at the end of 
the previous step, bathymetry and salinity. This is done in two steps, where the 
autocorrelation in turning angles  is calculated first  
t* = R2 + b0 t-1  
Eqn. A32 
and their dependence on bathymetry and salinity is calculated in a second step, 
t = t* (b1 wt-1 + b2 st-1 + b3) 
Eqn. A33 
The parameters a0, a1, a2, b0, b1, b2 and b3 are new to DEPONS 2.0 (see Table 2). 
Fine-scale movements, in contrast to large-scale movements, are guided by a 
gradually decreasing memory of the foraging success in recently visited food patches. 
The animals’ tendency to move towards previously visited food patches is determined 
by their memory of where they have found food in the past, and how much. This 
spatial memory move, VM, is determined by 
VM = ΣM[c] i[c] 
Eqn. A34 
where M is a measure of the amount of food that an animal remembers that it has 
found in patch c, weighed by the costs of going there (i.e. a measure of the benefit of 
returning to patch c). The animals’ memory of previously visited patches decrease 
logistically with time. The shape of the logistic function is controlled by the reference 
memory decay rate rR. i is a unity vector pointing in the direction of patch c (Nabe-
Nielsen et al. 2013b).  
Separate deterrence vectors are calculated for responses to noise from pile-driving and 
ships at every tick and the vector with the strongest impact (i.e., largest value of |VD|) 
is the one that influences an animal’s subsequent movement vector (V)). The 
standardized resultant vector, i.e., the fine-scale move taken in the presence of noise, 
is then determined by  
 
Eqn. A35 
This equation is equivalent to Eqn. A2 of Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2014). In Eqn. A35 V* 
has been standardized to have the same length as VS, so the length of the step is not 
affected by the noise level. 
If the move defined by V* would cause the porpoise to move to an area with too 
shallow water (<wmin) it turns in the direction with deepest water (40°, 70°, 120° or 
180° as needed).

2.7.4 Update energy level and mortality 
Porpoises increase their energy levels Ep when moving through food patches and 
reduce the amount of food (energy) in the patches equivalently. They never eat more 
than 99% of the food they encounter in a patch, and always leave at least Umin food 
units (see Table 1) to allow food levels to replenish (see section 2.7.6). Their energy 
levels are scaled to lie in the range 0–20. The animals consume a smaller proportion 
of the food as their energy levels increase from 10–20, and animals with an energy 
level of 20 do not consume any of the food they encounter (Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2014).  
Porpoises use a season-dependent amount of energy Euse in every step. They spend 
more energy during the summer (Euse×Ewarm in the months May–September and 
Euse×(0.5×(1–Ewarm)+1) in April and October) and when they are lactating (Euse×Elact).  
The porpoises’ risk of dying increases as their energy levels decrease. The yearly 
survival probability sy (Figure 10) is calculated as 
 
Eqn. A36 
which is subsequently converted to a per-step survival probability 
 
Eqn. A37 
If ω1 is a random number in the range 0–1 and the animal is lactating, the calf is 
abandoned if ω1 > ss (lactating calves do not appear as independent individuals in the 
model). If ω1 > ss and the animal is not lactating, it dies (Sibly et al. 2013). 
These processes take place in every time step. 
2.7.5 Update food distribution map 
Every month (on simulation day 0, 30, 60, 90, … , and 330), a new food distribution 
map is loaded. The map is used for determining the maximum amount of food that 
can be present in food patches in different parts of the landscape (Figure 1). This is 
derived from season-specific maps of porpoise densities in the North Sea (Gilles et al. 
2016) for North Sea simulations and values provided by Edrén et al. (2010) for 
simulations using the Kattegat landscape. The spatial distribution of food patches 
remains constant.  
2.7.6 Update salinity map 
Every month a new sea surface salinity map is loaded. The map enables fine-scale 
movements to depend on local salinity conditions (Figure 1). 
2.7.7 Update patch energy level 
Takes place every day. 
Ec[t+1] = Ec[t] + rU × Ec[t] (1– Ec[t] / Mc[t]) 
Eqn. A38 
where rU is the food replenishment rate, Ec[t] is the food level in patch c at time t and 
Mc[t] is the maximum amount of food in each patch. The equation is equivalent to 
Eqn. 3 of Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2013).

2.7.8 Calculate mating dates 
Takes place every year, on 1 January. Each porpoise’s mating date, tmating, is drawn 
from a normal distribution. 
2.7.9 Daily tasks 
This submodel is executed at the end of every day, i.e. every 48th time step. 
Update each animal’s movement mode based on its daily average energy level. 
Animals start using large-scale movements when their energy levels have decreased 
for ttodisp consecutive days. 
Die of old age: Animals older than tmaxage years are removed from the simulation. 
Mate and become pregnant: If the simulation date is tmating the animals that are not 
already pregnant mate and become pregnant with a probability h.  
Give birth: Animals that have been pregnant for tgest days give birth to a calf and start 
lactating. 
Wean calf: Lactating animals stop nursing their calves after tnurs days. This results in 
the creation of a new independent individual in the model with probability 0.5 
(assuming equal sex ratios). From the time of weaning male porpoises are omitted 
from the model. 
See Table 1 for list of parameters related to animal life history. 
2.7.10 Update residual deterrence 
Animals may keep being deterred by a noise source for some time after the noise 
stops. This is termed ‘residual deterrence’. At the end of each step their movements 
become less biased by these noises that they are no longer exposed to. The decrease in 
residual deterrence is controlled by ψdeter, so 
 |VD|t+1 = |VD|t (100–ψdeter)/100 
Eqn. A39 
After tdeter time steps animals are assumed to stop being deterred by noise sources that 
no longer emit noise. By default tdeter is set to 0 (see Table 2).

3 Data evaluation 
 
This TRACE element provides supporting information on: The quality and sources of numerical 
and qualitative data used to parameterize the model, both directly and inversely via calibration, and of 
the observed patterns that were used to design the overall model structure. This critical evaluation will 
allow model users to assess the scope and the uncertainty of the data and knowledge on which the 
model is based.                                                                                         
 
Summary: 
There are 70 parameters in version 3.0 of DEPONS, all of which can be 
specified by the user. Thirteen are related to animal life history and 
energetics, 45 are related to animal movement and reactions to noise, and 
10 are related to general model behavior (specification of input and 
output files etc.). Three of the parameters related to animal movement 
and reactions to noise are not used by default, but maintained to increase 
model flexibility and facilitate easy re-parameterization for other 
applications. Many of the 41 parameters related to animal life history, 
energetics and movement are region-specific. Values are obtained from 
the literature for six parameters; four parameters controlling the 
animals’ response to noise and large-scale movements were calibrated 
following a pattern-oriented modeling approach.

3.1 
Parameters and data related to animal life history and energetics 
The processes and parameters related to birth and death of animals and to how animal 
survival is determined by energetic status are identical to the ones in the models 
described in Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2014, 2018). 
Seven of the 13 parameters related to life history and energetics were obtained from 
the literature (Table 1). The parameter values for h and tmature were based on data 
collected in the northwest Atlantic, off the coast of Maine (United States). The 
parameters are inherently hard to estimate due to difficulties studying harbor

porpoises in the wild, and may vary among regions and among years. The parameters 
tgest and tnurs are based on a Danish study of captive animals and on studies of harbor 
porpoises in Danish waters. There are no data on how much the parameters vary 
among populations. The parameter tmaxage is an upper limit for how old porpoises are 
likely to get, based on records of stranded animals in Denmark. The parameter tmating 
may vary among populations and years, but again this is difficult to assess due to the 
limited number of studies of porpoises in the wild. The parameter Ewarm was obtained 
from a study of captive animals, based on their food consumption. It is difficult to 
assess to what extent the parameter varies among animals and whether it depends on 
the size and health of the animals. 
Six parameters related to energetics were either obtained from unpublished studies or 
calibrated based on general considerations regarding animal energetics (Sibly et al. 
2013). The parameter Elact was obtained from a study of Danish captive animals. This 
is unlikely to vary much among populations due to energetic constraints related to 
animal energy consumption, but is likely to vary depending on the age of the lactating 
calf. The parameter Umin is the minimum amount of food in a patch. The unit is 
scalable to kJ and other measures of energy content (hence we use the term ‘relative 
unit’ for energy-related variables). Umin influences how fast food recovers in a patch 
after being nearly depleted. Euse was calibrated to ensure that the population reached a 
dynamic equilibrium size, assuming that food recovered after approximately 2 days. 
This is based on the observation that satellite tagged porpoises in the inner Danish 
waters often return to the same area after approximately two days (J Nabe-Nielsen, 
unpubl. Data). As porpoises have a high energetic demand (Wisniewska et al. 2016), 
we take such repeated returns to the same area as an indication that food has 
recovered. Details of the calibration procedure are provided in the appendix of Nabe-
Nielsen et al. (2014). When letting the maximum amount of food in a patch be 1 
during winter in the inner Danish waters simulations, the average food level in the 
patches was 0.3914 (Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2014). In the current study, the average food 
level in the patches was scaled to be the same (see input data), i.e. the average food 
level was assumed to be the same in the North Sea and the inner Danish waters. One 
unit of food in a patch is equivalent to one unit of energy available for the porpoise 
agents, and it is assumed that no energy is lost when food is consumed. The value of β 
determines the relationship between the animals’ energetic status and their risk of 
dying (Eqn. A36). The value used in this study was obtained through calibration (see 
details in Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2014). The relationship between the animals’ energetic 
status and mortality is likely to vary among populations, but the use of a slightly 
different value of β has a very small impact on population dynamics and carrying 
capacity (appendix of Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2014). The value of rU was calibrated to 
ensure that the population reached a stable size (Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2013a, 2014). 
Unfortunately, there are no field studies that allow us to determine how rU varies 
among geographic regions.

model described by Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2013b, 2014, 2018) by allowing turning 
angles and step lengths to depend on bathymetry and salinity, which are the main 
environmental drivers of fine scale movements of porpoises in the North Sea (van 
Beest et al 2018a; see Section 2.7.3 for details). Fine-scale movements are influenced 
by the first 13 parameters in Table 2.

Table 3. Model parameters related to animal movements and response to noise from ships. Values for the last 
16 parameters are from Frankish et al. (in prep). The ‘code names’ are the names used in the Repast 
computer code. 
Fine-scale movements are simulated using a mixture of correlated random walk 
(CRW) behavior and spatial memory moves. The parameterization of the fine-scale 
movement model was done after log10 transforming the distance moved per 30-
minutes step, as step lengths were approximately log-normally distributed in the 
movement data that was used for parameterization (van Beest et al. 2018a). The CRW 
is specified using the parameters ax, bx, R1, and R2, where Rx provide mean and 
standard deviation in distance moved per step and in turning angles. The spatial 
memory behavior is controlled by the parameters rS, rR, and k. All parameters were 
calibrated to ensure realistic fine-scale movement behavior in the North Sea 
landscape. 
3.2.2 CRW component of fine-scale movements 
Real porpoises’ tendency to zig-zag and their speed while doing so can be influenced 
by local environmental conditions. In DEPONS this behavior is simulated using CRW 
movements. In DEPONS 2.0 to 2.3 the animals’ CRW movements have been 
calibrated based on data from a six animals equipped with V-tags in two areas of the 
Danish North Sea (van Beest et al. 2018a). The animals were observed in a wide 
range of environments, spanning from shallow near-shore areas to some of the

34 
deepest parts of the North Sea (Figure 11a). Their movements are therefore likely to 
be representative for animals in other parts of the North Sea as well, although a larger 
sample size is needed to fully understand how porpoise movements are related to 
environmental conditions in different parts of the North Sea. The CRW movements 
may not be representative for animals in the inner Danish waters. 
 
Figure 11. Movement tracks of 2 weeks used for calibration of fine-scale movements (a) from six 
animals equipped with V-tags and (b) tracks from six simulated animals released in the areas where the 
real animals were tagged. Differences in background color indicate water depth [m].  
Speed and absolute turning angles between consecutive 30-minute steps are mostly 
related to variations in salinity and bathymetry for real porpoises in the eastern part of 
the North Sea (van Beest et al. 2018a). The CRW movements of the simulated 
animals were therefore allowed to be influenced by these two variables in DEPONS 
2.x to ensure that simulated animals could respond to environmental variation in the 
same way as North Sea animals (Eqns. A31–A33). To do so we used pattern-oriented 
modeling (POM; Grimm et al. 2005; Kramer-Schadt et al. 2007; Hartig et al. 2011) to 
calibrate CRW movements to reproduce the speed and turning angle distributions 
observed for real porpoises (Figure 12), as well as the dependence of these variables 
on salinity and bathymetry (Figures 13–14). During the POM process we simulated 
multiple movement tracks where parameters controlling fine-scale movements (a0, a1, 
a2, b0, b1, b2, b3, R2) were changed step-by-step and iteratively until we found the 
optimal parameter value combination. Fine-scale movement parameters R1 and 
dmaxmove were not calibrated but taken directly from van Beest et al. (2018a). All 
simulations were run in the North Sea landscape using a population size of 100 and a 
simulation period of one year. In each simulation we tracked the movements of six 
simulated animals that had the same starting positions as the real animals. Simulated 
animals were only allowed to use CRW behavior (large-scale movements and spatial 
memory behavior were turned off; the latter was done by setting rS to 0.02 and rR to 
1). For each simulated movement dataset, we calculated speed and absolute turning 
angles between consecutive locations using the R-package adehabitatLT (Calenge 
2006). Simulated movement data were analyzed exactly as in van Beest et al (2018a) 
using generalized least square linear regression (GLS) models constructed in the R

package “nlme” (Pinheiro et al. 2015). The beta coefficients and autoregressive 
coefficients from each GLS on simulated data were compared to those obtained from 
GLS analyses on empirical data. We iteratively adjusted the parameter values until the 
simulated movement tracks (Figure 11), frequency distributions (Figure 12), and all 
GLS coefficients and autocorrelation values for both speed and turning angle analyses 
(Figures 13 and 14) were nearly identical to the corresponding values for wild animals 
(up to 2 decimals behind the comma).

3.2.3 Spatial memory component of fine-scale movements 
Real animals tend to stay in the same area for several days or weeks. To enable 
simulated animals to produce similar area-concentrated fine-scale movements, they 
were equipped with a spatial memory of where they have found food in the past. The 
behavior is controlled by the parameters rS (satiation memory decay rate, controlling 
whether animals keep using a correlated random walk), rR (reference memory decay 
rate, controlling animals’ ability to navigate back to previously visited patches), k and 
wmin. Here k is a constant that only influences animal movements in the rare cases 
where they do not have any memory of previously visited food patches (e.g. in the 
beginning of simulations). Wmin, which determines the minimum water depth required 
by porpoises, influences animal movements in the vicinity of the coast only. 
In DEPONS 2.0 the parameters rS and rR were re-calibrated using POM to ensure that 
simulated animals developed movement tracks that resembled those of 34 satellite-
tracked porpoises from Skagerrak and the North Sea (Figure 7) and that they had the 
same home range size, net squared displacement and residence times (Figure 15). The 
V-tag data that were used for calibration of fine-scale movements could not be used 
for calibrating rS and rR as V-tags are unable to store data from a sufficient number of 
days to enable spatial memory movements to emerge. Movement data for the satellite-
tagged porpoises included one location per day for 30 days, and the parts of the track 
that could be characterized as large-scale movements were removed prior to analyses. 
To do so, large scale-movements were identified using a Bayesian state-space 
switching model (SSM) specifically developed to detect switches in movement modes 
(i.e. fine vs. large-scale movements, also termed area-restricted search and transient 
behaviour) while accounting for uncertainty in the Argos positional estimates (sensu 
Jonsen et al. 2005). We fitted the Bayesian SSM using the R package “bsam” (Jonsen 
2016). With this approach two chains (movement modes) are fitted in parallel and 
estimated jointly for all individuals based on variation in speed and turning angles. 
We allowed a burn-in of 60 000 samples per chain and generated 40 000 samples 
thinned by every 20th sample to remove autocorrelation. Using only fine-scale 
movement data as identified through the SSM, i.e. the parts of the tracks where 
animals did not use large-scale movements, we calculated the kernel home range size 
(km2) for each 30-day satellite-track using the href smoothing method in the R 
package adehabitatHR (Calenge 2006). The net squared displacement was calculated 
by taking the mean of the squared distance moved between each location and its 
starting location (km2), and residence time (days) was calculated by taking the mean 
time spent in a circle with radius of 5 km across all locations in a 30 day period 
(Barraquand & Benhamou 2008; Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2013b).

Figure 15. Parameterization of spatial memory component of fine-scale movements, i.e. the parameters 
rS and rR. The y-axis shows home range size (HR; km2 / 1000), net squared displacement (NSD; km2 / 
10) and residence times (RT; days) for real and simulated animals (N = 34 for each group). The panel 
outlined in green highlights the combination of rS and rR values (both 0.04) that produced patterns 
(mean and variance) that best resembled those based on real animals. 
To calibrate the animals’ spatial memory parameters, we simulated multiple 
movement tracks using a range of values for rS and rR to find the parameter value 
combination that caused home range size, net squared displacement and residence 
times to simultaneously resemble those of real animals. All simulations were run in 
the North Sea landscape, with a population size of 10 000 and for a 6-year period, 
using the first 5 years as a burn in period to allow simulated animals to develop a 
spatial memory of profitable patches and to aggregate in areas with sufficient food. 
We tracked the movements of 34 simulated animals that had the same starting 
positions as the real animals tracked in the North Sea. Large-scale movements for 
simulated animals were allowed (using default large-scale movement from DEPONS 
1.1) and the parameters controlling CRW movements were set to their default values 
as calibrated based on North Sea animals (Table 2). Each simulated movement track 
was subsampled to have one location per day (at noon) for 30 days (as for the 
satellite-tracked porpoises), and we removed all locations where agents were in large-
scale movement mode. We then calculated home range size, net squared displacement 
and residence times exactly as we did for the real animals, based on the parts of the 
tracks where animals did not use large-scale movements. Visual inspection of the 
results revealed that a value of 0.04 for both rS and rR resulted in home range sizes,

39 
net squared displacement and residence times that corresponded most closely to those 
observed for real animals (Figure 15). 
The animals’ fine-scale movements are not only influenced by the movement-related 
parameters but also by the spatial distribution of food patches and the amount of food 
in these patches. In the current study the maximum amount of food in the patches was 
modeled based on porpoise survey data from the North Sea (Gilles et al. 2016), which 
suggested high food availability in the western-central part of the North Sea (see 
Figure 1). The spatial distribution of the patches, i.e. the size of the patches and the 
distance between them, was random (following Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2013b, 2018). 
Further refinements of these maps can be expected to make fine-scale movements 
even more realistic for North Sea conditions. In order to use the model in other 
regions of the world the fine scale movements should be calibrated based on realistic 
food distribution maps to enable realistic variations in the simulated animals’ fine 
scale movements. 
3.2.4 Parameters related to large-scale movements 
Large-scale movements are by default modeled based on a persistent spatial memory 
(PSM) behavior that enables animals to navigate back to the 2 km × 2 km cell group 
where they have previously obtained the highest energy intake rate and that is located 
at their preferred large-scale movement distance. The six parameters used for 
controlling large-scale movements are listed in Table 2. In DEPONS 2.0, large-scale 
movements have been re-calibrated after calibrating the animals’ fine-scale 
movements to resemble those of North Sea animals. In the Kattegat landscape the 
large-scale movements should be simulated with large-scale movement developed 
specifically for this area (InnerDanishWaters movements) to enable animals to 
navigate realistically through the Danish straits. 
The value of the parameter ddisp (distance moved per large-scale move) has been 
obtained directly from the movements of the 34 satellite-tracked porpoises that were 
also used for calibrating the spatial memory component of fine-scale movements (see 
section 3.2.3). After classifying different portions of these tracks as either fine-scale 
or large-scale movements using an SSM, ddisp was obtained as the average distance 
moved per 30 min for animals using large-scale moves. To find the optimal values of 
the parameters PSM_angle (maximum turning angle after each large-scale move) and 
PSM_dist (preferred large-scale movement distance) we simulated animal movements 
based on a range of parameter values. The aim was to make simulated tracks resemble 
those of the satellite-tracked porpoises as closely as possible, after resampling both 
datasets to one position per day for 100 days. For PSM_angle we evaluated the 
resemblance for the values 20°, 40° and 60°, and for PSM_dist we considered mean 
values in the range 150–350 km (in increments of 50 km). For standard deviation in 
PSM_dist a random value of 100 was selected (arbitrary value). All possible 
combinations of PSM_angle and PSM_dist were tested. For each combination we 
recorded the movements of 34 porpoise agents over an 11-year period. All 
simulations were run in the North Sea landscape, with a population size of 10 000 and 
for a 11-year period, using the first 10 years as a burn in period to allow simulated 
animals to develop a spatial memory of profitable cell groups. All agents were 
initialized at Skagen (northern Denmark), which was where the satellite-tracked 
animals were tagged.

Figure 16. Parameterization of PSM_dist and PSM_angle in the PSM-Type2 long-distance movement 
behavior. Track statistics calculated based on satellite-tracked animals are labeled ‘ref’. PSM_dist is 
composed of a mean and a standard deviation that jointly determine the distance that animals prefer to 
move when using PSM_Type2; the figure is based on tracks simulated with PSM_dist standard 
deviation set to 100. NSD means net squared displacement. The best correspondence between tracks of 
simulated and wild animals was obtained for a PSM_dist of 300 km and SPM_angle of 20°. 
We compared the tracks of simulated animals with those of satellite-tracked animals 
based on three statistics: home range sizes, maximum net squared displacement 
(Max(NSD)) and track tortuosity (as measured using the sinuosity index; Benhamou 
2004). The three statistics were calculated based on the first 100 daily positions for 
each track, irrespective of the animals’ movement mode. We calculated the kernel 
home range size (km2) for each 100-day satellite-track based on both fine-scale and 
large-scale movement data, using the href smoothing method in the R package 
adehabitatHR (Calenge 2006). Max(NSD) was calculated as the maximum distance 
between the different positions in the track and the start of the track, squared. For 
each track statistic the median values for the 34 satellite-tracked animals were 
compared to the corresponding median values for 34 simulated animals. 
The track statistics of simulated animals’ corresponded closely to those of satellite-
tracked porpoises for a PSM_dist value of 300 km, combined with a PSM_angle value 
of 20° (Figure 16). The movement tracks of simulated animals (Figure 17) also 
resemble those of satellite-tracked porpoises (Figure 7) relatively closely, although 
the satellite-tracked animals appear to occasionally disperse very far, into areas that 
are not included in the simulation landscape.

Figure 17. Daily movements of 34 simulated porpoises using the values of PSM_dist and PSM_angle 
that best enabled them to produce home range sizes, track tortuosity and net squared displacements that 
best resembled real animals. 
The parameter PSM_tol, which defines the tolerance band within which a porpoise 
agent should find the most profitable PSM-cell when starting to use large-scale 
movements, was calibrated visually to make the simulated tracks resemble those of 
satellite-tracked animals as closely as possible. This was done both before and after 
calibrating PSM_angle and PSM_dist. For PSM_log, a simple one-parameter logistic 
function (Eqn. A28) was used to enable animals to gradually become less directed the 
closer they were to their target. For this parameter an arbitrary value was used, but 
visual inspection of the tracks suggested that these were not strongly influenced by 
the choice of PSM_log. The movement statistics were also relatively insensitive to the 
choice of PSM_log.  
The parameter ttodisp determines the number of days with decreasing average energy 
levels before the animal starts using large-scale movements. The default value is 
based on the observations that captive porpoises lose weight after not eating for three 
days, which in nature would probably cause them to move towards more profitable 
foraging areas. The parameter wdisp determines the minimum depth at which porpoises

were allowed to use large-scale movements. The value was visually assessed based on 
satellite-tracking data. 
The parameters used for defining large-scale movements in this study are not 
necessarily suitable for other geographic regions. Two of the parameters were 
obtained through inverse parameterization (using POM) based on animal tracks 
observed in the north-eastern part of the North Sea. The shapes of these tracks are 
influenced by the food distribution (defined as background maps; see Input data) and 
by proximity to land. As many of the simulated animals moved into the central part of 
the North Sea, their movements were less constrained by land than those of the 
satellite-tracked animals tagged by Skagen. This enabled them to develop more 
rounded home ranges than the ones observed for free-ranging animals. Animals may 
also be influenced by other environmental conditions than proximity to land, which 
could cause them to move differently in other parts of the North Sea and elsewhere 
(other prey species, presence of predators etc.). Unpublished data for satellite-tracked 
porpoises reveal that porpoises move over larger distances in South Greenland waters 
(N. Nielsen, pers. comm.), suggesting that it may be important to re-parameterize the 
model based on local movement data when using it for populations outside the North 
Sea. The differences between the tracks of simulated and free-ranging animals are 
discussed further in the section ‘Assumptions regarding large-scale movements’.

3.2.5 Parameters related to response to noise 
The porpoise agents’ response to noise is controlled by the parameters T, c,, 𝛽̂, 
𝛼̂, dmax_deter, tdeter, ψdeter, dmin_deter_ships, pship_int_, pship_noise_, pship_dist_, pship_noise_x_dist_, 
cship_int_, cship_noise_, cship_dist_ and c ship_noise_x_dist_  ( 
Table 2 and 3). The first two and the last eight parameters are used for calculating the 
length of the deterrence vector (VD in Figure 4) in response to pile-driving events and 
ship noise, respectively. T determines the maximum distance at which porpoise 
movements are influenced by noise for a given pile-driving event, whereas c 
determines the strength of their response at close ranges. For ship noise, values of 
pship_int_, pship_noise_, pship_dist_, pship_noise_x_dist_, cship_int_, cship_noise_, cship_dist_ and c 
ship_noise_x_dist_  determine the relationships between ship noise (Rship), proximity 
(Dship), and the probability (pship) and magnitude (cship) of porpoise deterrence in day 
and night (). 𝛽̂ and 𝛼̂ determine the transmission loss for sound from pile-driving 
events (see Eqn. A1). Dmax_deter determines the maximum distance at which porpoises 
can be influenced by noise (irrespective of noise level), dmin_deter_ships the minimum 
distance at which porpoises can be influenced by noise from ships, while tdeter and 
ψdeter jointly determine the ‘residual deterrence’, i.e., the animals’ tendency to move 
away from an area for some time after the noise has stopped. 
The parameters T and c were calibrated to make recovery of simulated porpoise 
densities resemble those observed during construction of the Gemini wind farm 
(Figure 18; Luuk Folkerts, unpubl. Data) assuming spherical spreading of sound (i.e., 
𝛽̂=20 and 𝛼̂=0). In the field, the relative porpoise densities were measured using 
CPODS that recorded the clicks emitted by echo-locating porpoises. Sound source 
levels were calculated based on noise data collected at different distances from two of 
the pile-driving sites using hydrophones (Figure 3). This was done using linear 
regressions, assuming spherical spreading of noise (Eqn. A1). Simulations were based 
on a landscape that included virtual CPODs (each covering 2  2 cells) placed in the 
exact same positions as those used in the field. The simulations included pile-driving 
events with the same timings and sound source levels as the real ones (Figure 3). Due 
to the limited size of the landscape, large-scale movements were turned off. We ran 
simulations using a range of parameter combinations (c in the range 0.00–0.15 and T 
in the range 151–156 dB SEL). The simulated porpoise densities were standardized to 
obtain the same overall mean and variance as observed around Gemini. The aim was 
to find the values of c and T that minimized the sum of the squared differences 
between field and simulated data across a range of different distances from the nearest 
pile-driving. The optimal values of c and T were therefore the ones that yielded the 
smallest value of  in  
 
Eqn. A40 
where n is the number of simulated porpoises observed at a particular distance 
interval d from a virtual CPOD and p is the number of porpoises observed at the same 
distance interval from a pile-driving at Gemini and t is time since end of pile-driving. 
We used the distance intervals d shown in Figure 18. 
The smallest value of  was obtained for T=152.9 dB SEL and c=0.07 (Figure 19). In 
Figure 19,  is referred to as ‘Sum of Squares Deviation’.

The parameter dmax_deter defines an upper boundary for the distance at which porpoises 
can react to noise. It is only influencing model behavior if sound source levels (SL) 
are so high that they would otherwise have caused animals to react at very long 
distances. The reason for introducing the parameter dmax_deter is that a study of 
Cuvier’s beaked whale suggests that the way cetaceans respond to noise may depend 
on the distance to the noise source rather than on the received sound level (DeRuiter 
et al. 2013), at least for relatively low received levels. The parameter dmax_deter makes 
it possible to ensure that simulated animals are only deterred out to a certain distance, 
irrespective of the noise level. When dmax_deter is set to 1000 km (default), the 
parameter has no impact on the simulated animals’ response to noise, as this is far 
beyond the area where R>T (see Figure 4). 
 
 
Figure 19. Calibration of c and T using pattern-oriented modeling. The target was to find values of c 
and T that enabled the model to produce porpoise recovery rates that resembled those observed at 
different distances from real pile-driving. This was obtained for c=0.07 and T=152.9 (red dotted line). 
The parameters tdeter and ψdeter determine how long porpoises keep moving away after 
the sound that deterred them has stopped, i.e. their ‘residual deterrence’ behavior. 
Tdeter determines the number of 30-minute time steps that porpoises remain deterred 
and ψdeter determines the reduction in deterrence after each time step (in percent, i.e. a 
reduction relative to the deterrence that remained prior to the step). Our knowledge of 
how free-ranging porpoises respond to loud noises is limited to one study (van Beest 
et al. 2018b). Here some porpoises appeared to remain slightly deterred up to ca. 10 
hours after being exposed to loud impulsive noises, whereas others did not respond. 
As there is limited evidence that animals remain deterred when they are no longer 
exposed to noise, we use a default value of tdeter=0 (i.e. no residual deterrence). 

--- Page 45 ---
TRACE document: DEPONS 3.0 
 
45 
The parameters related to the animals’ response to noise are likely to be site-specific. 
The way porpoises and other cetaceans respond to noise may depend on their 
condition, on whether the area where the disturbance takes place is an important 
foraging ground and on whether they have become habituated to noise (Richardson & 
Würsig 1997; Bejder et al. 2006). These factors are likely to cause the optimal values 
of c and T to vary among different wind farm construction sites. In Gemini, porpoises 
only respond to noise out to a distance of 6–12 km (Figure 18), which is less than 
reported in most studies. Diederichs et al. (2009) found reduced porpoise numbers at 
14–18 km from active pilings during construction of the Alpha Ventus wind farm, and 
Tougaard et al. found animals to respond at distances >20 km from Horns Reef I 
(Tougaard et al. 2009) in the eastern North Sea. Brandt et al. (Brandt et al. 2011) 
reported negative effects out to a distance of 17.8 km from the Horns Reef II wind 
farm, but no effect at 22 km. This suggests that T values that would cause animals to 
respond approximately 20 from the piling zone might be more representative for 
simulating population effects of pile-driving in the North Sea. 
Simulated porpoises’ response to noise from ships is derived from a study 
investigating the response of wild porpoises to ship noise. This was done using GPS 
tagged animals around Denmark (Frankish et al. In prep). Dose-response curves 
suggest that tagged individuals responded to passing vessels by being deterred, and 
with increasing likelihood the louder and closer these ships were. The response 
probability varied diurnally, and response is thus modelled differently for daylight vs. 
darkness periods (Figure 6). The parameter dmin_deter_ships defines a lower boundary for 
the distance at which porpoises react to ship noise. 
3.3 
Parameters controlling general model behavior 
The DEPONS model can run simulations using any landscape provided by the user, or 
one of the four built-in landscapes (parameter: ‘landscape’). It requires eight different 
background maps to run simulations with any given landscape (see input data). The 
default landscape is the North Sea (Figure 1). This landscape was used for assessing 
the impact of pile-driving noise on the porpoise population. The Gemini landscape 
was created for parameterizing the animals’ response to pile-driving noise (see section 
Parameters related to response to noise). Simulations can also be run in the DanTysk 
landscape, or using a Homogeneous landscape, which has no land/coast line and 
where habitat quality and bathymetry are constant, or in a user-defined landscape. 
Although DEPONS simulations use realistic landscapes, agents that hit the edge of a 
landscape are unable to exit or disappear. It is sometimes (e.g., during model 
development and testing) useful to allow the landscape to wrap (i.e., using a non-
bounded landscape). Wrapping of landscape borders is only possible in the 
Homogeneous landscape (parameter: ‘wrapBorderHomo’).  
The DEPONS model can run a wide variety of wind farm construction scenarios 
(parameter: ‘turbines’), including the three North Sea scenarios used in this study 
(Figure 2), the Gemini scenario (Figure 3) and the DanTysk scenario (not shown). It is 
possible to run simulations with alternative scenarios by selecting the ‘User-def’ 
turbines file after modifying the accompanying file (see input data). The default 
option is to run simulations without construction (with ‘turbines’ set to ‘off’).  
The number of simulation years is set with the parameter “simYears”. The default 
value is 50 simulation years, which allows for a 20 year burn in period, a 10 year

period at carrying capacity prior to wind farm construction, a 10 year period with pile-
driving noise, and a 10 year recovery period post wind-farm construction. 
The number of porpoise agents to be created at the start of a simulation is set with the 
parameter ‘porpoiseCount’. The default value of 10 000 will produce a stable 
population size in the North Sea landscape within the first 10 years of simulation. 
Movement data of porpoise agents and the sound pressure levels (SPL) they receive 
from passing ships (loudest SPL per tick stored in column ‘LoudestShipSPL’) can be 
recorded by specifying how many porpoises to track using the parameter 
‘trackedPorpoiseCount’. Two options are available to track movements of porpoise 
agents. First, the user can record movement data for an unlimited number of agents 
from the very start of the simulation. To do so, the user must provide the starting 
position (x, y coordinates), and heading of the first step for each porpoise agent to 
track in a comma separated text file (trackedporpoise.txt; file without headers) stored 
in the data/landscape directory. If the file is empty, the tracked porpoise agents will 
have random starting locations. The second option to track movements of porpoise 
agents allows the user to set a delay in the start of the recording (i.e. starting from a 
specified time step during the simulation). This is done by writing a single line, in a 
comma separated text file (trackedporpoise.txt; file without headers) stored in the 
data/landscape directory, starting with the text ‘delayedSelection;’ followed by the 
time step when recording should initiate and the starting position (x, y coordinates). 
Here only one starting position can be specified, and movements of porpoise agents 
closest to the specified starting location are recorded. The two options of tracking the 
movements of porpoise agents cannot be combined.  
The harbor porpoise population is subject to multiple anthropogenic disturbances and 
stressors, including by-catch in commercial gillnet fisheries (Read et al. 2006; van 
Beest et al. 2017). Although by-catch was not considered in the current study, it is 
possible to assess the impact of by-catch on the population in the DEPONS model 
(parameter: ‘bycatchProb’). The parameter was first introduced by Nabe-Nielsen et al. 
(2014) and ported directly into the DEPONS model (as part of the one-to-one 
conversion from NetLogo to Repast).  
Two different parameters are used for code testing. The parameter ‘randomSeed’ 
makes it possible to repeatedly reproduce the exact same simulation (when not set to 
‘random’). This option should not be selected when investigating population effects of 
pile-driving noise. A range of built-in testing options were included to test model 
output under various conditions (parameter ‘debug’, see details in the section 
‘Implementation verification’).

4 Conceptual model evaluation 
 
This TRACE element provides supporting information on: The simplifying assumptions underlying 
a model’s design, both with regard to empirical knowledge and general, basic principles. This critical 
evaluation allows model users to understand that model design was not ad hoc but based on carefully 
scrutinized considerations.  
 
Summary: 
The DEPONS model builds on a model developed for simulating harbor 
porpoise movements and population dynamics in the inner Danish waters. 
We discuss the simplifying assumptions underlying the submodels that 
control animal movement, energetics and responses to noise. We further 
discuss the assumptions related to large-scale movement behavior and 
reactions to noise that were introduced when extending the model for 
simulating effects of pile-driving noise in the North Sea. The rationale for 
the design and choice of simplifying assumptions are discussed. 
 
4.1 
Assumptions regarding fine-scale movements 
The fine-scale movement behavior builds on the assumption that animals attempt to 
optimize their foraging when not exposed to noise. Fine-scale movements are 
influenced by the animals’ energetic status and proximity to places where they have 
previously found food, but they are unaffected by social behavior, animal age and 
whether animals are nursing or not. The movements were parameterized based on 
fine-scale movement data collected for six animals in two areas in the North Sea (van 
Beest et al. 2018a). Van Beest et al. tested whether distance moved per 30-minutes or 
turning angles between steps were related to a wide range of environmental variables, 
and found salinity and bathymetry to be most important (Figures 12 and 13). Fine-
scale movements are therefore assumed only to be influenced by these two kinds of 
environmental variability in DEPONS 2.x†.  
The values of rR and rS, which control the animals’ short-term spatial memory, were 
re-calibrated based on satellite tracking data from 25 animals tagged in the eastern 
part of the North Sea. These are assumed to be representative for North Sea animals. 
4.2 
Assumptions regarding effects of noise 
Noise from pile-driving operations and shipping is assumed to influence the fine-scale 
movements of harbor porpoises by introducing a bias to their moves (Figure 4). This 
type of response to noise enables the model to reproduce the decline in population 
densities often observed in the vicinity of pile-driving (Brandt et al. 2011, 2018; 
Dähne et al. 2013) and short-term avoidance of individual ships (Barlow 1988; Palka 
& Hammond 2001; Oakley et al. 2017), but the only study where wild porpoises were 
exposed to noise did not indicate that it introduces a consistent bias to their fine-scale 
movements (van Beest et al. 2018b; Xao et al. in prep). This suggests that there is 
 
† This contrasts with DEPONS 1.1, where fine-scale movements were assumed to be independent of 
environmental variability. 

--- Page 50 ---
TRACE document: DEPONS 3.0 
 
50 
considerable variation in how porpoises respond to noise. For instance, porpoises may 
react by altering their dive behavior or ceasing foraging with potential implications 
for individual fitness (Wisniewska et al. 2018; Frankish et al. In prep). DEPONS does 
not include such variability, which is hence currently assumed to be unimportant for 
population impacts of noise. 
In DEPONS the parameters c, T, pship_int_, pship_noise_, pship_dist_, pship_noise_x_dist_, 
cship_int_, cship_noise_, cship_dist_, c ship_noise_x_dist_ , which control the strength of the 
animals’ tendency to move away from noise, were assumed to be constant. This may 
not be the case for wild animals, where habituation to noise may cause these 
parameters to change over time. Such habituation to noise may be prevalent in 
cetaceans (Richardson & Würsig 1997; Nowacek et al. 2007). The way wild animals 
react to noise may also depend on their energetic status and the quality of the area 
where noise exposure takes place (Bejder et al. 2006). This is to some extent 
accounted for in DEPONS, as animals that get disturbed in an unfavorable area are 
more likely to get permanently displaced than animals that get disturbed in a 
favorable area. This results from the simulated animals’ tendency to return to places 
where they have previously found food when they have not been able to find food 
using a random search. 
4.3 
Use of constant vital rates 
The animals’ probability of becoming pregnant, the gestation time, nursing time and 
mating day are all assumed to be constant. In reality, they may be influenced by the 
animals’ health, which in turn depends on a number of environmental parameters, and 
they may also be influenced by the age structure of the population. The choice of 
using temporally constant parameter values was based on a lack of empirical data 
indicating otherwise. 
4.4 
Assumptions regarding energetics 
Population dynamics are directly linked to the energetic status of individual animals, 
which is in turn determined by the individuals’ ability to replenish energy reserves by 
foraging in patches with high food levels. Assumptions regarding the animals’ energy 
balance and availability of food in the landscape are therefore crucial to the behavior 
of the model. 
The energy balance of individual animals depends on their energy use, which is 
assumed to be constant (except for increases associated with lactation and during the 
summer months). This is likely to be realistic, as animals must maintain a fairly 
constant speed to forage enough to meet their high energy requirements (Kastelein et 
al. 1997; Wisniewska et al. 2016; Andreasen et al. 2017). 
The dynamics of the food patches is influenced by how fast food replenishes after 
being consumed. This is determined by the food growth rate (rU) and by how much 
food that is left in a patch when it is nearly depleted (Umin). The selected value of rU 
(which allowed food to replenish after approx. two days with the selected value of 
Umin) was based on the observation that satellite-tracked animals in the inner Danish 
waters often returned to the same place several times over a period of a few weeks. As 
the porpoise depends on a continuously high food intake this was thought to indicate 
that food had replenished in the areas visited.  

--- Page 51 ---
TRACE document: DEPONS 3.0 
 
51 
Both the animals’ food intake rates and the amount of time they spend within a 
confined area depend on the spatial distribution of the food patches. There is currently 
no data on the spatial distribution of the fish that porpoises forage on in the North Sea 
(or in the inner Danish waters). The only indication that the spatial distribution of 
food patches used in DEPONS is sensible comes from the similarity of the simulated 
movement tracks and those of satellite-tracked animals (Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2013b). If 
the patch density had been too low, animals would return to the same area too rarely, 
causing them to develop larger home ranges than they do in nature. 
4.5 
Assumptions regarding large-scale movements 
The large-scale movement behaviors included in DEPONS assume that animals have 
a persistent spatial memory (PSM) of places they have previously visited. This is 
supported by the satellite tracks for animals tagged by Skagen in northern Denmark, 
that show that porpoises have the ability to navigate back to places they have not 
visited for weeks or months (Figure 7). This is usually considered an indication of a 
spatial memory (Berger-Tal & Bar-David 2015). The tracks of the animals tagged by 
Skagen also suggest that North Sea porpoises move far to forage in particular areas, 
although it is unclear if this results from an attempt to maximize food intake. The 
large-scale movements that are implemented in the model assume that animals move 
towards the area where they have previously obtained the highest energy intake rates 
and that are not too far away, which could enable them to optimize their foraging 
behavior. Similar optimal foraging behavior has been demonstrated for several other 
species (e.g. Austin et al. 2004; Fagan et al. 2013). The large-scale movement 
behaviors in the model also build on the assumption that animals gradually drift away 
from the route that would take them straight to the place where they previously 
experienced the highest energy intake rate. This allows them to gradually become 
more exploratory when approaching a region with high food availability. 
The calibration of the large-scale movement behavior assumes that home range sizes 
are influenced by the same environmental factors for simulated and free-ranging 
animals. This is, however, not always the case. Some of the satellite-tracked animals 
moved out of the area used in the simulation model, and as their movements were not 
constrained by the presence of a landscape border, their home ranges were potentially 
larger than those of simulated animals (7 vs. 7). 
5 Implementation verification 
 
This TRACE element provides supporting information on: (1) whether the computer code for 
implementing the model has been thoroughly tested for programming errors and (2) whether the 
implemented model performs as indicated by the model description. 
 
Summary: 
The computer code was continually tested during model development to 
ensure that each consecutive step in development was only initiated after 
the model had passed a wide range of visual and statistical tests. Visual 
inspection of movement tracks was carried out using the NetLogo and 
Repast graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The majority of the program code 

--- Page 52 ---
TRACE document: DEPONS 3.0 
 
52 
was initially developed and tested in NetLogo and subsequently scrutinized 
and re-implemented in Repast by independent programmers. Only the 
animals’ response to noise, the CRW component of the fine-scale behavior 
and the large-scale movement behaviors were not part of the NetLogo 
version of the model. 
 
5.1 
Testing the fine-scale movement model and reactions to noise 
The fine-scale movement model was the first component of the DEPONS model to be 
developed. The structure of this submodel is described in the section ‘Fine-scale 
movements’. All aspects of the model were kept exactly as described in the original 
publication (Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2013b), except that the random-walk component was 
allowed to be influenced by salinity and bathymetry in DEPONS 2.x (Eqns. A7–A9).  
During development of the NetLogo version of the fine-scale movement model, 
dedicated code was used for testing the different submodels (controlled with the 
parameter ‘debug’ in the NetLogo code, see DOI:10.5281/zenodo.53097). The debug 
value 1 was used for developing and testing the porpoises’ behavior when 
approaching land and to develop code that enabled them to back-track in rare 
situations where they got trapped by land. When setting the debug parameter to 2, the 
porpoises’ behavior when approaching land was tested to ensure that animals turned 
as little as possible, while still avoiding land (distance to land, positions and turning 
angles were written to the console for a subset of the simulated animals). Debug value 
3 was used for debugging turning angles related to CRW behavior. Debug value 4 
enabled inspection of the length of the porpoises’ attraction to previously visited food 
patches by writing the perceived/remembered value of the patch and the direction of 
the attraction vector to the console. Debug value 5 was used for writing out the 
position of the porpoise and the length of the contribution of the CRW and spatial 
memory moves to the console (i.e. the relative contribution of VS [Eqn. A6] and VM 
[Eqn. A10]), allowing a close inspection of whether turning angles and the direction 
of the vector that characterized fine-scale movement were related to food availability 
and proximity to the visited patch as expected. This dedicated debugging code was 
used in combination with stress tests, where simulations were run with extreme 
parameter values, to identify errors that would be difficult to detect with the 
default/realistic parameter values. 
The updated version of the fine-scale movement model, where turning angles and 
movement speed were allowed to be influenced by salinity and bathymetry, was 
tested and calibrated based on the North Sea landscape. Simulated tracks were 
inspected visually (Figure 11b) and using a wide range of movement statistics 
(Figures 12–14) to ensure that simulated animals behaved likes real animals. In 
DEPONS 2.x the part of the code controlling the animals’ spatial memory while using 
fine-scale movements was kept as in the NetLogo version of the model. 
The animals’ behavioral reaction to noise was verified by checking that the length of 
the deterrence vector VD was exactly as specified in Figure 4 and the ODD. We used a 
visual inspection of the simulation to double-check that simulated porpoises reacted to 
noise out to the distance specified in Eqn. A1 in the submodel ‘Porpoises detect noise’ 
(see also Figure 20). 
The flexible movement model introduced in DEPONS 2.1 (see Eqn. A1) and used in 
later versions of DEPONS was tested by comparing animals’ deterrence from 

--- Page 53 ---

53 
simulated pile-driving and ship noise to the theoretical deterrence values calculated 
manually.

circle indicates the area where porpoises react to noise when the model is parameterized based on data 
from the Gemini wind farm. 
5.2 
Testing the large-scale movement model 
The persistent spatial memory behavior (PSM-Type2), which is the default large-scale 
movement behavior in DEPONS 1.1 and 2.0, was developed exclusively in 
Repast/Java. We tested that the model produced the desired output by plotting and 
analyzing the movement tracks for animals using large-scale movements. This was 
done using the parameter “trackedPorpoiseCount” and the trackedporpoise.txt file that 
records movements (coordinates) of random agents after each time step. We plotted 
how the turning angles following each large-scale movement step changed as the 
simulated animals approached their targets while using large-scale movements 
(Figure 9) and by monitoring variations in step lengths and energy levels. We 
developed a dedicated unit test to ensure that energy intake and amount of time that 
porpoises spend in different 2  2 km cell groups is correct. Further, we conducted 
stress tests of PSM-Type2 by analyzing simulated tracks for extreme values of ddisp, 
PSM_angle, and PSM_log. 
5.3 
Testing population dynamics 
Population dynamics were tested by inspecting how porpoise agent movements and 
survival were influenced by their energetic status and by analyzing relationships 
between the average energetic status of porpoises and food patches. The inspection of 
individual porpoise agents was done using the built-in inspector in NetLogo as well as 
custom made code for writing out the track, food consumption, energy use and fate of 
individual porpoises. Population dynamics were inspected using the built-in 
functionality for creating dynamic plots in NetLogo and by close inspection of 
generated output. 
In order to test if population dynamics were fundamentally different in DEPONS 2.0 
as compared to DEPONS 1.1, we ran the three North Sea wind-farm construction 

--- Page 54 ---
TRACE document: DEPONS 3.0 
 
54 
scenarios (see Input data) using DEPONS 2.0. In these simulations we used an 
unrealistically low response threshold of 127.98 dB SEL, corresponding to a response 
distance of 200 km, to amplify the impacts of noise and more easily observe the effect 
of altering the pile-driving schedule. 
The results of these simulations are very similar to those obtained using DEPONS 1.1 
(see Figure 3 in Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2018). When simulating the population impact of 
noise using a response threshold of 152.9 dB, which caused animals to change 
behavior up to 1.135 km from the pilings, population dynamics were indistinguishable 
from those in the baseline scenario (results not shown). But when using a response 
threshold of 127.98 dB, the population size was reduced during the 10-y wind-farm 
construction period. The results were qualitatively the same as those obtained using 
DEPONS 1.1, i.e. the impact of noise was smaller in the ‘Random, slow’ scenario 
than in the two other scenarios, and the population was heavily affected by noise in 
2014 in the “Ordered, slow” scenario. The impacts of pile-driving were, however, 
slightly larger in DEPONS 2.0 than in DEPONS 1.1 for all scenarios. For example, 
the population was reduced by approximately 20 % in the “Random, slow” scenario in 
2012 when using DEPONS 1.1, but approximately 30 % when using DEPONS 2.0.

response distance of 200 km, simulated using DEPONS 2.0. The number of simulated porpoises was

between consecutive pilings. Colored dots indicate wind farms with 60 turbines each; dark blue 
indicates areas with high food levels. In simulations with a response distance of 1.135 km (as in the 
Gemini wind farm), population dynamics were indistinguishable from the baseline scenario.

6 Model output verification 
 
This TRACE element provides supporting information on: (1) how well model output matches 
observations and (2) how much calibration and effects of environmental drivers were involved in 
obtaining good fits of model output and data.  
 
Summary: 
DEPONS is able to reproduce the fine-scale and large-scale movement 
patterns observed for porpoises in nature. It is also able to reproduce the 
relative animal densities observed at different distances from a wind farm 
during construction. These three types of output were parameterized using 
pattern-oriented modeling. Emergent patterns related to landscape-scale 
variations in population size could not be compared to field observations 
due to lack of data.  
 
6.1 
Types of model output 
The DEPONS model writes out four data files after each simulation. (1) The first file 
(.csv) reports the change in population size over time. By default, it produces one line 
of output per 30-min time step, but the reporting interval can be changed in the 
graphical user interface (GUI). (2) Data on the distribution of porpoise agents (.csv) 
among ‘blocks’ in the simulation landscape (defined in a raster file, see the section 
’Input data’), which is by default recorded for each 30-min step. (3) Data on the 
movements (.csv) of individual porpoise agents during the simulation, measured and 
recorded for each 30-min step. By default, one porpoise is tracked, but multiple agents 
can be tracked using the parameter trackedPorpoiseCount. Tracked porpoises also 
store their energy level, deterrence level, and position in each time step, and tracking 
can be delayed to omit data from the first simulation years. (4) Life-time reproductive 
output is saved for each porpoise agent when it dies. The age of the animal is recorded 
when it dies, along with the tick count at the time of death, number of calves born 
(both males and females), number of calves weaned (only females; males are removed 
from the simulation when they are weaned, assuming that 50% are males) and the 
type of large-scale movement used. 
In the GUI version of the model an additional data set is written out: Data on number 
of animals per age class in the population and number of animals that have died in the 
preceding year in that age class. When running simulations in batch mode only the 
first three files are produced, but in addition the associated parameter input values 
used during the simulation are written to a separate file. The data files are written out 
to the working directory when simulations are run in the GUI while output from the 
batch procedure is written out to the ‘output’ folder within the working directory. 
Each output file has a date and time stamp in the title, which reflects when the 
simulation finished. 
In DEPONS 2.3 and later, hydrophones record sound from ships whenever enabled. 
For each tick each hydrophone records sound from the loudest ship at the end of each 

--- Page 56 ---
TRACE document: DEPONS 3.0 
 
56 
tick, along with the location, name, speed and source level of the ship that the sound 
originates from.  
The output files generated by DEPONS can be imported, manipulated, analyzed and 
plotted using the DEPONS2R package for R (R Core Team & Team 2021). 
6.2 
Comparison of model output and observations 
Only animal movement patterns and recovery of local population densities after pile-
driving could be compared to corresponding field data recorded in the North Sea. The 
emergent population dynamics could not be compared to field data, as the available 
data on variations in population densities are only available on a relatively rough 
temporal and spatial resolution for the North Sea (Hammond et al. 2013). In the inner 
Danish waters the predecessor of the DEPONS model was, however, capable of 
reproducing the spatial distribution observed for porpoises using acoustic survey data 
(Figure 7 in Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2011). The age class distribution observed for 
simulated animals that died each year corresponded to the one observed for stranded 
animals along the Danish shores (Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2014). 
The fine-scale movement model enabled animals to develop a range of track 
characteristics observed for animals in the North Sea (Figures 12–14). In version 2.0 
of DEPONS, the correlated random walk component of the fine-scale movement 
model was calibrated to ensure a close match with field data collected in the North 
Sea (by iteratively calibrating the parameters ax, bx, m, R1 and R2 as described in the 
section 3.2.1; see Table 2 for description of parameters). Subsequently the parameters 
rR and rS were calibrated using pattern-oriented modeling (POM) to ensure that 
animal home range sizes, net squared displacement and residence times closely 
resembled those observed for satellite-tracked animals (see details on POM). Here 
residence time is a measure of how long animals have spent in the neighborhood of 
each position in a track, which is often interpreted as a measure of how suitable the 
area is for foraging (Barraquand & Benhamou 2008). Fine-scale movements are 
related to bathymetry and salinity in the North Sea (van Beest et al. 2018a), and these 
variables were therefore allowed to have a direct impact on the distance animals 
moved per step and on turning angles in DEPONS 2.0. 
The recovery of relative porpoise densities after pile-driving ended resembled those 
observed at different distances from the Gemini wind farm during construction 
(Figure 18). The recovery resulted from the simulated animals’ tendency to move 
back to known food patches after deterrence stops.  
The simulated large-scale movement patterns matched those observed for satellite-
tracked animals in the north-eastern part of the North Sea after calibrating parameters 
related to persistent spatial memory (see details on POM for large-scale movements). 
7 Model analysis 
 
This TRACE element provides supporting information on: (1) how sensitive model output is to 
changes in model parameters (sensitivity analysis), and (2) how well the emergence of model output 
has been understood.

Summary: 
A sensitivity analysis was performed to explore how the equilibrium 
population size changed in response to variations in each of the parameters 
in the model. The emergent equilibrium population size was most sensitive 
to variations in food replenishment rate and to parameters related to 
animal energetics, but relatively insensitive to changes in the parameters 
related to animal movements. The analysis was conducted based on 
DEPONS 1.1, with fine-scale movement parameters calibrated based on 
data from the inner Danish waters. It is discussed to what extent the 
realism of the patterns that emerge from the model have been tested 
against field data. 
 
7.1 
Sensitivity analysis 
7.1.1 Sensitivity – parameters related to general porpoise behavior  
We conducted a sensitivity analysis to explore how the equilibrium population size 
changed when varying parameters related to life history, energetics, fine-scale 
movements and large-scale movements in simulations without noise (Figure 22). 
Parameters were changed one at a time to produce a local sensitivity analysis (cf. Bar 
Massada & Carmel 2008). In this study parameters were increased or decreased by 
20% relative to their default values and the corresponding impact on equilibrium 
population size was calculated as the mean daily population size for 8 replicate 
simulations. For the sensitivity analyses we used 40-year simulations, but calculated 
the equilibrium population size based on the last 20 years only (a 20-year burn-in 
period was always sufficient to ensure that the population had stabilized). The 
analysis was conducted based on DEPONS 1.1, with fine-scale movement parameters 
calibrated based on data from the inner Danish waters and PSM-Type2 large-scale 
movements parameterized based on North Sea animals. The results may therefore not 
be valid for DEPONS 2.x. 
The equilibrium population size was most sensitive to variations in parameters related 
to energetics (2nd group of parameters in Figure 22), and variations in the food 
replenishment rate rU were particularly important. The default value for this parameter 
caused food to replenish after approximately 48 hours (see appendix of Nabe-Nielsen 
et al. 2013b). When increasing rU by 20% relative to its default value (see Table 1) 
food replenished faster, leading to generally higher food availability and a larger 
population size. The equilibrium population size is nearly equally sensitive to 
parameters that influence the individual animals’ energy consumption per time step, 
Euse, their increased energy use while lactating, Elact, and increased energy use in 
periods with warm water, Ewarm. It is, however, insensitive to variations in the survival 
probability constant β, which determines the exact relationship between the animals’ 
energetic status and their survival probability.

Figure 22. Sensitivity analysis for parameters related to animal life history, energetics, fine-scale 
movements and large-scale movements. Bars show changes in equilibrium population size when 
increasing or decreasing each parameter by 20% relative to its default value. Error bars show 
confidence intervals based on 8 replicate simulations. The analysis was based on DEPONS 1.1, which 
used fine-scale movements calibrated based on data from the inner Danish waters and a different large-
scale movement behavior than DEPONS 2.0. 
Equilibrium population size was less sensitive to variations in parameters related to 
animal life history (1st group in Figure 22), fine-scale movement (3rd group) and large-
scale movement (4th group). One exception is the maximum distance moved during a 
fine-scale move, dmaxmove. When decreasing this parameter by 20% relative to its 
default value (provided in Table 2) it caused the mean population size to decrease by

16.5%, suggesting that the distance animals move while using fine-scale movements 
is important for their ability to rapidly return to previously visited patches when they 
do not find much food moving at random. For R1 and R3, which control distance 
moved and relationship between turning angle and speed during fine-scale 
movements, respectively (see Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2013b), only the parameter means 
were varied (standard deviation components were kept constant). The parameter R3 
was not included in DEPONS 2.0 or later. 
Only parameters that could potentially influence the behavior of all animals, and 
where an adjustment of ±20% made sense, were included in the sensitivity analysis. 
The sensitivity to the life history/energetics parameters tmaxage, Einit, tmating, Umin was 
not studied. The tmaxage only influenced the few, old animals. Einit was only important 
during the burn-in period. For tmating it did not make sense adjusting by ±20%. The 
same was the case for R2 (turning angle between consecutive fine-scale moves), 
which had a mean of 0. Umin affects the time it takes food in patches to replenish, 
which could be adequately analyzed by adjusting rU. PSM_tol presumably mostly 
affected animals while they gathered information about potential areas to move 
towards using large-scale movements (i.e. during the burn-in phase). The parameters 
wdisp, wmin influenced only the relatively few animals that were close to land, and 
varying these parameters by ±20% therefore inevitably has small impact on overall 
population dynamics. 
7.1.2 Sensitivity – parameters related to impacts of noise 
To assess the model’s sensitivity for parameters related to responses to noise, we 
measured the population size in the year where it was most affected by noise. This 
happened in the second year of the 10-y wind farm construction period in Scenario 1 
(i.e. in year 2012 in the ‘Random, slow’ scenario; Figure 3 in Nabe-Nielsen et al. 
2018). The population effect of noise was measured after increasing or decreasing the 
noise parameters by 20%, one at a time, and recording the corresponding mean 
population size in eight replicate simulations. The same was done for the default 
parameter values, which yielded the ‘reference level’, where animals responded up to 
8.9 km from the noise source. The results of this analysis are shown in the TRACE 
document for DEPONS 1.1 (Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2018).  
7.1.3 Sensitivity – impact of energetics parameters on response to noise 
To test if the population impact of noise was sensitive to the choice of energetics 
parameters, which were the parameters with the largest influence on equilibrium 
population size (Figure 22), we increased or decreased these parameters one at a time 
in simulations including noise (Supporting Information (SI) for Nabe-Nielsen et al. 
2018). This is equivalent to testing for interactions between T and each of the 
energetics parameters. This analysis was conducted based on DEPONS 1.1 and fine-
scale movements calibrated based on data from the inner Danish waters.  
The population impact of noise was sensitive to Elact, Ewarm and rU, as changing either 
of these parameters caused the population size during the second year of the wind 
farm construction period to differ from the reference population size (i.e. the 
confidence intervals did not overlap with the reference value; see SI for Nabe-Nielsen 
et al. 2018). When reducing Elact or Ewarm by 20%, wind farm construction noise no 
longer had a significant impact on the population, even when letting animals be 
deterred up to 204 km from the piling. The population impact of noise was not 

--- Page 60 ---
TRACE document: DEPONS 3.0 
 
60 
sensitive to changes in Euse or , but a 20% decrease in Euse caused the impact of noise 
to be non-significant. Only an increase in Ewarm caused noise to have a larger impact 
on the population, but only slightly so. Although improved estimates of the noise 
parameters could potentially result in more accurate estimates of the population 
impacts of noise, it is unlikely that larger population effects would be predicted with 
moderately altered energetics parameters. 
7.2 
Tests of emergence 
The model produces four different emergent patterns: (1) population size, (2) spatial 
distribution of animals, (3) their age class distribution, and (4) local recovery of 
populations after exposure to pile-driving noise (see ‘Design concepts’). All four 
patterns emerge from ubiquitously valid mechanisms derived from ‘first principles’ 
(Nathan et al. 2008; Sibly et al. 2013), including use of energy for maintenance and 
movement and acquisition of food by actively searching for optimal foraging areas. 
Such models where population and community-level patterns emerge from adaptive 
traits related to general evolutionary and physiological principles are more likely to 
maintain their predictive power across a wide range of environmental conditions than 
other models (Stillman et al. 2015).  
In order to test which elements of the model were responsible for the observed 
emergent patterns, we gradually refined the model until reaching the level of 
complexity present in the current version of the DEPONS model. While increasing 
model complexity we monitored the changes in population size and spatial 
distribution of animals and in the animal movement patterns. The simplest model, 
where animal movements were simulated using a correlated random walk model 
without spatial memory of previously visited patches did not allow realistic fine scale 
space-use patterns to emerge. This suggested that the model was too simple to 
represent real animals (see Table A1 in Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2013b for details on the 
relationship between animal space use and spatial memory). Inclusion of a mechanism 
that allowed animals to return to previously visited food patches (see ‘Fine-scale 
movement’) allowed simulated animals to develop space-use patterns that closely 
resembled those of satellite-tracked animals by balancing their tendency to move at 
random (i.e. following a correlated random walk) and their tendency to return to 
previously visited food patches (Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2013b). This also enabled 
simulated animals to forage optimally, thereby facilitating fitness-maximization. 
Although this suggested that the inclusion of spatial memory in the model was 
required to faithfully simulate the movements and energetics of real animals, it did not 
permit the simulated animals to develop long-term home ranges that resembled those 
observed for satellite-tracked animals. It is essential that simulated animals have home 
ranges of a realistic size to ensure that they have access to the same amount of food 
resources as real animals have. Only in that case will the decreased food intake that 
they experience when being scared away from a wind-farm construction site result in 
a realistic decrease in the population size. The model was only able to simulate home 
ranges that resembled those of satellite-tracked animals after including a large-scale 
movement behavior that allowed individuals to return to the area where they had 
previously experienced the highest energy intake rate. The inclusion of this large-
scale movement behavior in the model resulted in the emergence of realistic 
movement patterns at multiple spatial and temporal scales (see Figure 16) and in the 
emergence of realistic local population densities. This suggests that the mechanisms 
that control animal foraging and food acquisition in the current version of the 

--- Page 61 ---

61 
DEPONS model are sufficiently realistic for the purpose of the model. It also suggests 
that the model cannot be simplified without compromising its realism. 
8 Model output corroboration 
 
This TRACE element provides supporting information on: How model predictions compare to 
independent data and patterns that were not used, and preferably not even known, while the model was 
developed, parameterized, and verified. By documenting model output corroboration, model users learn 
about evidence, which, in addition to model output verification, indicates that the model is structurally 
realistic so that its predictions can be trusted to some degree.  
 
Summary: 
The model’s ability to faithfully predict population effects of wind farm 
construction noise cannot be corroborated using independent data, as 
harbor porpoise population estimates based on field data are scarce and 
inherently imprecise. The simulated effects of noise on local population 
densities could, in principle, be corroborated using independent data, but 
due to the scarcity of such data from comparable wind farm construction 
sites this has not been done. 
 
Only some of the model predictions can be directly compared to independent data due 
to the scarcity of harbor porpoise survey data from the North Sea and due to the large 
variability associated with such data. Four different patterns emerged from the model: 
(1) variations in total population size in time; (2) spatial distribution of animals, (3) 
their age class distribution, and (4) local recovery of populations after exposure to 
pile-driving noise (see ‘Design concepts’). In the following we discuss to what extent 
each of these patterns can be corroborated using independent data and which types of 
independent data that should be collected to further evaluate the realism of the model 
predictions. 
A direct comparison of the predicted porpoise population size with population 
estimates based on survey data (e.g. those collected during SCANS surveys; SCANS 
II 2008) is unlikely to be informative for two reasons: (i) The North Sea population 
estimates based on SCANS data are associated with considerable variation, making it 
relatively easy for the simulation model to produce population estimates within the 
confidence limits of these estimates. (ii) The SCANS surveys are conducted relatively 
infrequently, making them unsuited for validation of the fine-scale temporal 
population dynamics produced by the DEPONS model. The robustness of the model 
predictions regarding variations in population sizes in space and time is therefore only 
ensured by the generality of the mechanisms responsible for producing this emergent 
pattern. 
The predicted spatial distribution of animals could, in principle, be compared to 
independent data, but although alternative porpoise distribution maps exist (Reid et al. 
2003) they are partly based on the same underlying data as the study by Gilles et al. 
(2016), so they are not truly independent. The spatial distribution patterns produced 
by the predecessor of the DEPONS model in the inner Danish waters, did, however, 

--- Page 62 ---
TRACE document: DEPONS 3.0 
 
62 
closely match those obtained from acoustic survey data that were not used for 
designing or calibrating the model (see page 23 in Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2011; monthly 
average densities per 40 km x 40 km block). These simulations of the inner Danish 
waters population did not include wind-farm construction scenarios. The model’s 
ability to reproduce the porpoise distributions observed in nature is reassuring, as this 
causes a realistic proportion of the simulated porpoises to get exposed to noise during 
wind farm construction scenarios. 
The age class distribution of the simulated animals can be directly compared to the 
age class distribution of stranded and by-caught animals. This comparison has already 
been conducted in the inner Danish waters (Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2014). Here the age 
class distribution that emerged from the model corresponded closely to that in the 
field data. 
Recovery of local population densities following the construction of individual wind 
turbine foundations was studied in the Gemini wind farm during construction. This 
data set was the only one available providing both noise measurements and relative 
porpoise population densities at different distances from the mono-pile pilings, and 
where no noise mitigation was used. This data set was used for simultaneously 
calibrating deterrence and local population recovery (Figures 13 and 14). As the only 
available data set was used for model calibration, there are no data available for 
model output corroboration. 
In addition to using already collected data for model output corroboration, the 
collection of local population densities around other wind farm construction sites 
would help us obtaining a better understanding of the structural realism of the 
DEPONS model and of the generality of the model predictions. This would also make 
it possible to verify that the sound propagation model employed is realistic for the 
sound frequencies that porpoises react to. In such field studies it is essential to 
measure how porpoise densities change during and after pile-driving at large distances 
from the wind farm construction sites in order to determine whether model predictions 
are realistic at these distances. 
It is possible that the animals’ tendency to return to areas they have been deterred 
from depends on the food availability in that area, in nature as well as in the model. 
Animals are more likely to return to profitable areas. The model’s ability to faithfully 
simulate local population recovery in areas with different levels of food availability 
could be corroborated using long-term data collected with CPODs in areas where 
wind farms are constructed. This would provide an independent measure of local food 
availability as well as local population recovery.

Changes in DEPONS version 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 3.0 
 
The documentation for DEPONS 1.1 was presented in the online Supporting 
Information for Nabe-Nielsen J., van Beest F.M., Grimm V., Sibly R.M., Teilmann, J. 
& Thompson, P.M. (2018): Predicting the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on 
marine populations. Conservation Letters e12563. Below we outline the changes 
implemented in code, parameter settings and documentation since then. Text related 
to changes implemented in versions 2.1 and 2.2 are highlighted in green, those 
reflecting changes in version 2.3 and later are highlighted in orange. 
 
Problem formulation updated to reflect changes made in 2.0 (released 21 
January 2019) ............................................................................................................. 3 
The term "dispersal" has been changed to "large-scale movement" 
throughout.  
Grid cells are now also characterized by sea surface salinity .................................... 6 
In DEPONS 1.1 animals turned less steeply when moving fast. This 
undocumented aspect of the fine-scale movement behavior has been removed 
in DEPONS 2.0. 
Animals now inherit a map of the profitability of different cell groups from 
their mother (used in PSM-Type2 large-scale movement behavior) ......................... 9 
Turning angles no longer depend on speed when animals use fine-scale 
movements, as there was no evidence that this was the case for North Sea 
animals ..................................................................................................................... 23 
Fine-scale movements (i.e. both parameters controlling CRW movements and 
those controlling spatial memory behavior) have now been re-parameterized 
based on GPS tracking data collected in the North Sea ........................................... 30 
Fine-scale movements now depend on local salinity and bathymetry ......... 17 and 33 
The large-scale movement behavior PSM-Type2 has been re-calibrated based 
on data from 34 satellite-tracked North Sea porpoises after re-calibrating the 
fine-scale movements based on GPS-tagged North Sea animals. This is now 
done using a pattern oriented modeling process that resembles to one used for 
calibrating fine-scale movements............................................................................. 39 
The parameters controlling animals' response to noise (c and T) were re-
parameterized after updating fine-scale movement parameters ............................... 43 
Tracked porpoises now also store information about their energy level, 
deterrence level, and position in each time step ...................................................... 55 
Reproductive output for each simulated porpoise is now written to a separate 
output file ................................................................................................................. 55 
In the DEPONS 1.1 distribution on GitHub, the file ‘…/wind-
farms/NorthSea_scenario3.txt’ did not correspond to scenario 3 as described 
in Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2018). This has been corrected in DEPONS 2.0. 

--- Page 71 ---

71 
The input data files for salinity and prey are now updated every month, and 
they are named differently than in previous versions of DEPONS  ........................ 11 
Sound modelling has been made more flexible (see Eqn. A1), allowing the 
user to specify the spreading loss factor and absorption coefficient for sound  ...... 30 
It is now possible to do simulations using the Kattegat landscape, assuming 
that the fine-scale movement behaviour calibrated for animals in the North 
Sea is also suitable for this landscape. ..................................................................... 46 
The large-scale movement behaviour previously used in the Kattegat 
landscape (Nabe-Nielsen et al. 2014) has been introduced to DEPONS................. 23 
Simulation of noise-emitting ships has been enabled. As the porpoises’ 
response to ship noise is not fully understood, the feature is only included to 
facilitate further studies ............................................................................................ 13 
As of DEPONS 2.2 ship routes are defined using the same coordinate 
reference system as the underlying landscape, rather than grid coordinates. 
As of DEPONS 2.2 blocks-files can be used for counting animals within 
specific regions when running simulations for the Kattegat-landscape ................... 23 
As of DEPONS 2.2 small values of 𝛼̂ are no longer rounded to zero when 
using the GUI ........................................................................................................... 31 
DEPONS 2.2 has been tested using Java 8 and Repast Simphony 2.7. Minor 
rounding errors are known to occur when using Java 11. 
DEPONS 2.1 introduced a bug which caused animals to respond to noise 
from the very start of the simulations rather than starting at the tick specified 
in the ‘wind-farms’ text file. This bug was removed in DEPONS 2.2. 
In DEPONS 2.3 the way ship movements are controlled and calculation of 
sound source levels for ships have been updated ..................................................... 14 
DEPONS 2.3 has been tested using Java 11 and Repast Simphony 2.9.1. 
System tests have been used to ensure that the update did not affect 
simulation outputs. 
DEPONS 2.3 allows the user to record sound from ships whenever 
hydrophones are enabled. ......................................................................................... 14 
In DEPONS 3.0 ship noise now propagates according to the Aquarius v3 
range-dependent shallow-water sound propagation model. ..................................... 14 
In DEPONS 3.0 response of porpoises to ship noise has now been updated .......... 14

Appendix 1: Methodology for geoacoustic parameter selection for the 
generation of North Sea sound maps 
Timo Constantin Gaida, Bas Binnerts, and Christ de Jong, 
 
Geoacoustic parameters, such as the density, sound speed, and attenuation coefficients 
of the seabed are input parameters for underwater sound modelling. Since these 
parameters are difficult to measure in-situ over large areas, they are often derived 
from surrogate variables. Two commonly used seabed classification descriptors 
connected to sound speed and attenuation of the seabed surface layer are (i) the 
median grain size (d50) and (ii) the Folk classification scheme (Folk 1954). Median 
grain size is considered to be the most robust predictor of seabed acoustic parameters 
(Ainslie, 2010). While a full-coverage Folk classification map is available for a large 
part of the Northern European Waters on the EMODnet portal, a median grain size 
map only exists for part of the North Sea (Figure S1) but not for Kattegat and inner 
Danish waters (to the knowledge of the authors). 
 
 
Figure S1 (Left) Folk map displaying 7 substrate classes. The map is generated by 
reclassifying the diverse national data using the modified Folk classification scheme 
(EMODnet Geology, 2021). (Right) d50 (median grain size) map of the North Sea 
(Bockelmann et al., 2018).  
Overlapping areas between the two maps in the North Sea were considered to 
evaluate and statistically quantify how median grain size (continuous variable) relates 
to different Folk classes (categorical variable). In areas where the different sediment 
maps overlapped, we extracted values of median grain size data which fell within 
polygons of different Folk class categories. This allowed for the calculation of a 
distribution of grain size M (logarithmic scale; ϕ) per Folk class with a median, mean 
and standard deviation (Table S1).

Finally, the median grain size map of Bockelmann et al., 2018 was extended with the 
Folk class map, where each polygon was assigned to a median grain size using the 
established relationship with the Folk class (Figure S2).
